#     --origin https://mouseflowapp.vercel.app
#
# WHY THIS COMPILES INSTEAD OF DOWNLOADING A BINARY
#
# The Windows agent is fetched and run in memory with nothing installed. macOS has no equivalent, and the two
# honest options are a signed and notarised .app or a script the user then grants permissions to. There is no
# Apple Developer certificate in this project, so a downloaded binary would arrive quarantined and Gatekeeper
# would refuse it - the user would have to strip the quarantine attribute by hand, which is both worse advice
# and worse security than what this does. A binary compiled ON this machine is never quarantined.
#
# WHY IT IS AN .app AND NOT A LOOSE BINARY
#
# Not packaging taste: on macOS a bare executable is not its own subject as far as permissions go. TCC blames
# the RESPONSIBLE process, which for anything launched from a terminal is Terminal. So a loose binary gets no
# prompt of its own, never appears in System Settings, and the only way to grant it anything is to hand
# Accessibility to your terminal emulator. A binary inside a bundle, launched with `open` or by launchd, is
# its own responsible process: its own prompt, naming itself, and its own switch.
#
# WHY A REBUILD LOSES THE PERMISSION, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT
#
# This is the thing that keeps biting. TCC stores a grant against the app's code signature, and for an ad-hoc
# signature that means the CDHASH of the binary. Rebuild, and the hash changes: the entry stays in System
# Settings, still switched on, and the new binary is not the one it was granted to. The switch is checked and
# the agent says no - which reads as macOS lying, and is in fact macOS being exact.
#
# So after a real rebuild the stale entry is reset, which turns "checked but broken" back into "asks you
# again". One prompt beats one mystery. And --fix-permissions does only that, for when the state is already
# wrong.
#
# The whole script is a function called at the very end. Piping to bash executes what has arrived so far, so
# a download cut off halfway would otherwise run half an installer.

  --origin URL        the page the agent will answer (default https://mouseflowapp.vercel.app)
  --port N            loopback port (default 8787)
  --no-login          do not start it at login (it is a login item by default, so
                      there is nothing to launch by hand, ever)
  --no-run            install and stop, do not start it now
  --foreground        run it in this window so its output is visible. Note: launched
                      this way it inherits Terminal's permissions rather than having
                      its own - for debugging a build, not for daily use.
  --fix-permissions   clear the stale permission entries and restart it, for when
                      System Settings shows it switched on and the agent still says
                      it has no access. A rebuild changes the binary's signature and
                      the old grant no longer matches it.
  --doctor            print everything about the install in one go - version, signature,
                      login item, port, permissions, log tail. Paste the output when
                      something does not work; "it does not work" is not a diagnosis
                      and this is what turns it into one.
  --uninstall         stop it, remove the login item and the installed files

Cleared. macOS has forgotten the old grants, so it will ASK again - which is the
point: the entry it was showing you belonged to an older build of the binary.

Say yes to both dialogs. If one does not appear, the switches are in System

Two permissions, both granted by you in System Settings, neither grantable by any installer:

  Accessibility     so it can record clicks, read what you clicked on, and click for you
  Screen Recording  so it can take a screenshot and read other applications' window titles

macOS asks the first time it needs each one, and the dialog says "MouseFlow Agent". The switches are in
System Settings, Privacy & Security.

If a switch is ON and the agent still says it has no access, the entry belongs to an older build of the
binary - the grant is tied to the exact signature. That is what this fixes:

  bash <(curl -fsSL ${origin}/agent/install-mac.sh) --fix-permissions --origin ${origin}

# The entitlements, which exist for exactly one reason: the hardened runtime.
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY IT LOOKED LIKE TCC. A Developer ID signature is applied with --options runtime,
# and under the hardened runtime a process is refused the microphone unless the binary CARRIES the
# entitlement - refused by the runtime itself, before TCC is ever consulted, so no dialog appears and
# nothing is written into System Settings. From the page it arrives as a plain getUserMedia failure, which
# reads as "the user said no" and sends everybody to look at a permission that was never asked for.
#
# So the Info.plist sentence and the WKWebView delegate were both necessary and both insufficient: three
# things gate one microphone, and two of them are silent.
#
# ONLY WITH THE CERTIFICATE. An ad-hoc signature is applied WITHOUT --options runtime, so the runtime does
# not gate anything and there is nothing for an entitlement to unlock; handing entitlements to an ad-hoc
# signature is a way to make codesign refuse the build instead.
