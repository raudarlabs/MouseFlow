.SYNOPSIS
  MouseFlow local agent. Records global mouse input and replays it, exposing a
  small HTTP API on loopback so the MouseFlow web app can drive it.

.DESCRIPTION
  The browser cannot see mouse events outside its own window, and cannot inject
  real OS clicks. This agent supplies both halves:

    recording  SetWindowsHookEx(WH_MOUSE_LL) on a dedicated message-pump thread
    replay     SendInput with absolute virtual-desktop coordinates

  It listens on http://127.0.0.1:<Port> and answers CORS preflights so an https://
  page (e.g. a Vercel deployment) can call it. Note that reaching loopback from a
  public origin also needs the user's Local Network Access permission in Chrome 142+;
  that is granted in the browser and cannot be granted by any response header here.

  API
    GET  /health          -> JSON {ok, version, screen, recording, playing}
    POST /record/start    -> JSON {ok}   ?moveMs=250 thins the pointer path for a long session
    GET  /record/status   -> JSON {recording, count, elapsedMs, part, moveMs}
    POST /record/drain    -> text/plain, what has piled up so far; RECORDING CONTINUES
    POST /record/stop     -> text/plain, one event per line (.mmmacro format)
    POST /replay          -> JSON {ok}   body: see FLOW BODY below
    GET  /replay/status   -> JSON {playing, step, steps, pass, passes, index, total}
    POST /replay/abort    -> JSON {ok}
    GET  /shot            -> JSON {ok, png, w, h, scale, originX, originY}  a look at the screen
    GET  /windows         -> JSON {ok, windows:[{title, process, active, minimized, x, y, w, h}]}
    GET  /pulse           -> JSON {ok, grid}  64x36 grey samples: cheap enough to poll while waiting
    GET  /shot?w=640      -> a smaller picture, for a caller told its request was too large
    POST /do              -> JSON {ok}   one action; body is key=value, see ACTION BODY below
    POST /autostart/enable  -> JSON {ok} - drops a launcher in the Startup folder
    POST /autostart/disable -> JSON {ok} - removes it

    action=key key=Enter ctrl=0 shift=0 alt=0
    action=activate title=Outlook            (or process=outlook)

  /windows exists because a screenshot is not the whole truth. An application that is minimised, or
  behind another window, is invisible to a picture - and something acting only on pictures will happily
  launch a second copy of a program that is already running, which is exactly what happened. The list
  says what is open; `activate` is how to get to it without opening anything.

  /shot and /do are what let the app describe a goal in words and have it carried out here rather
  than only replaying something recorded earlier: one is how it sees, the other is how it acts. Both
  work in virtual-desktop coordinates, the same space replay uses, and /shot reports the scale it
  shrank the image by so a point on the picture maps back to a point on the screen.

  Event lines use the Mini Mouse Macro layout: index | X | Y | delayMs | action
  where delayMs is the wait BEFORE the event. Lines starting with # are ignored.

  repeat / flowRepeat accept a count or the word 'forever' (0 means the same).
  flowRepeat=forever is how "restart the whole sequence when it ends" is
  expressed; repeat=forever on a single step loops just that step.

.PARAMETER Port
  Loopback port to listen on. Default 8787.

.PARAMETER AllowOrigin
  Which page the agent answers. Left out, it answers MouseFlow's own pages and
  anything on localhost, and refuses everything else - a request from any other
  site is turned away before it reaches a route.

  Pass an origin to narrow that to exactly one:
    -AllowOrigin https://mouse-agent.vercel.app

  Pass '*' to turn the check off entirely. That is what this agent did by default
  until 0.9.7, and it means any site open in your browser can press keys on this
  machine - CORS does not stop that, because a keystroke needs no reply.

.PARAMETER MoveThrottleMs
  Minimum gap between recorded move events. Default 10.

.PARAMETER MoveMinPx
  Minimum cursor travel before a move is recorded. Default 3.

.EXAMPLE
  .\mouseflow-agent.ps1

.EXAMPLE
  .\mouseflow-agent.ps1 -Port 8787 -AllowOrigin https://mouse-agent.vercel.app

.EXAMPLE
  # Start without downloading anything first. Autostart is unavailable this way,
  # because there is no local file for the logon launcher to point at.
  & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://mouse-agent.vercel.app/agent/mouseflow-agent.ps1))) -AllowOrigin https://mouse-agent.vercel.app

.NOTES
  Hold ESC during replay to abort. Ctrl+C stops the agent.
  The low-level hook stays installed for the agent's lifetime but events are
  only stored between /record/start and /record/stop.

  A SESSION THAT LASTS A WORKING DAY

  Eight hours does not fit, and what it does not fit is not a time limit - there is none - it is BYTES.
  Measured over the recordings this project actually made: 69 bytes an event, 23-42 events a second, so
  1.5-2.9 KB/s. The app refuses a payload over 400KB, which arrives around the third minute, and /record/stop
  used to be the only way events left the agent - so eight hours meant ~830,000 events held in memory and
  returned in one string.

  Two things answer that, and both are needed:

    /record/drain      takes what has piled up and KEEPS RECORDING. The caller writes each chunk away as its
                       own recording, so memory never holds more than one chunk. The clock is not reset, so
                       elapsedMs stays the time of the SESSION - a chunk that says 30 minutes and a session
                       that says eight hours are both true and both readable.

    ?moveMs=250        pointer movement is 93.75% of the events and 88.6% of the bytes (measured, same
                       place). At the 10ms default that is up to a hundred samples a second of a path that
                       nothing reads - not the transcript, not the story, not the analytics; they read
                       clicks, scrolls, keys and the change of window. At 250ms the "was somebody at this
                       machine" signal survives and a 30-minute chunk fits in those 400KB.

  Replay of a thinned recording is coarser, and deliberately so: an eight-hour session is recorded to be
  READ, not replayed. A short recording keeps the 10ms default and replays exactly as before.

         * WHAT WENT WRONG. A click on a message in Teams was recorded as
         * `clicked "Привет, та такие конторы обычно данные потом у себя сторят… Дима не захочет"` - somebody
         * else's conversation, in a recording, on an account, in every export. The accessibility name of a
         * chat message IS the message. Nothing was read wrongly; the control is genuinely called that.
         *
         * AND THE TYPE CANNOT TELL THEM APART. Measured over three applications' live trees: in Outlook an
         * `option` runs 275-376 characters and a `radio button` 174; a `menu item` 130; in Teams a `group`
         * reaches 523 and a `tree item` 123. Those are the same types that carry three-character labels.
         *
         * THE LENGTH CAN, and cleanly. The longest name on anything a person PRESSES was 43 characters
         * (a combo box) and 41 (a button), across all three. File Explorer had nothing over 60 at all.
         * Everything above 60 in the sample was content: a message, an email in a list, a chat summary.
         *
         * So over 60 characters the name is dropped and its LENGTH is written instead. What is left is
         * enough for a reader - "clicked a 147-character piece of text" places the step - and there is
         * nothing in the recording to leak, redact later, or think about before sharing it.
         *
         * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, said plainly rather than left to be discovered: a SHORT name that
         * happens to be content. A spell-check menu named "Spelling, сторят" carries one typed word in
         * sixteen characters, and no length rule can tell that from a label. See

         * WHY IT EXISTS. Every click on the Windows 11 taskbar came back as an unnamed `pane`, so a
         * transcript read "clicked on the desktop or the taskbar, at 898,1050" and never said which icon -
         * which is the one thing the reader wanted. The name was not missing. It was in the other
         * direction. Measured on a live desktop: AutomationElement.FromPoint over a taskbar button answers
         * with Shell_TrayWnd, the whole 1920x48 window, and the climb above that reaches the desktop root,
         * which is also unnamed. The button is FOUR LEVELS BELOW, inside a XAML island that the shell's
         * HWND provider does not hit-test into:
         *
         *   Shell_TrayWnd -> Windows.UI.Input.InputSite.WindowClass -> Taskbar.TaskbarFrame
         *     -> button "Google Chrome - 1 running window"   at 895,1032  44x48
         *
         * and the click in the complaint was at 898,1050, inside that rectangle. Start, the tray icons, the
         * clock and Show Desktop all name themselves the same way and were all being reported as nothing.
         *
         * THE SMALLEST AREA WINS, NOT THE FIRST FOUND, and that is measured rather than tidy. Shell_TrayWnd
         * lists a leftover ReBarWindow32 before the island, and it HAS a named child - "Running
         * applications" - so a depth-first search returns the strip and stops. The most specific rectangle
         * under the pointer is the thing a person means, and the strip merely contains it.
         *
         * THIS IS NOT THE TREE WALK PROTOCOL.md FORBIDS. That rule is about SEARCHING a subtree - FindFirst
         * over a browser's descendants, measured at 0.6-4.4 seconds per window. Only children whose
         * rectangle contains the point are opened here, so this follows a path down - a few, where windows
         * overlap - instead of sweeping one. Measured over every taskbar button, the tray, Start and the
         * clock: 32 elements read, 37ms warm, 153ms on the first call of a session. The caps are the
         * guarantee rather than the average: six levels, forty siblings a level, a hundred and twenty
         * elements in total.
         *
         * AND IT CANNOT MAKE AN EXISTING STEP WORSE, which is the property worth having in something people
         * install as a binary and update by hand: it runs only where the climb found no name at all, so
         * every step it can change is one that today says nothing. The measured 70.8% that already carry a
         * name never reach it.
         *
         * The macOS agent has had the same idea since 0.9.3 - see namedUnder/childrenAt there, written for
         * Chrome's tab strip. It differs in one respect: it takes the first name depth-first among the three
         * smallest candidates, which is what the taskbar's leftover strip defeats. Two shapes, one on each
         * platform, and the difference is deliberate.

         * its own modifier flags, and a measurement settled that those flags are SUFFICIENT - a window
         * reported the same NSEvent.modifierFlags for an event sent with flags only as for one sent with

         * property of the event, and therefore has to be released by whoever pressed it or it stays held
         * for the person afterwards. That is the same class of bug 0.19.0 found on macOS, where a latched
         * Command turned the next typing into Command+Z.

           THE RULE THIS BENDS, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT SAYS IT MAY. PROTOCOL.md forbids walking a window's
           tree on the input path, at 0.6-4.4 seconds per window. That number is about a RECURSION FROM THIS
           PROCESS - GetFirstChild, GetNextSibling, one cross-process call per element - and it is still
           true: measured here, an uncapped ControlViewWalker recursion over a 241-element window took 347ms
           and grows with the tree.

           A single FindAll with the condition on the SERVER side is a different call: the provider walks its
           own tree in its own process and answers once. Measured across eighteen real top-level windows -
           dbForge Studio, Outlook, Teams, Chrome, File Explorer, an Electron app - it ran from 0 to 319ms,
           with dbForge at 187ms for 28 named elements. Against a model turn of eight to fifty seconds that
           is nothing, and it is spent because the model ASKED rather than on every click.

           Bounded anyway, on a worker thread with a deadline: a provider that hangs must not take the action
           with it. An application that will not answer is a fact worth reporting, not a reason to wait.

         * because it has no name. That asymmetry was written down as a gap with "relaxing it changes the
         * size of every Windows result set and was not worth doing blind". Measured over fourteen live
         * top-level windows - Teams, Outlook (PWA), Chrome, an Electron app, three File Explorers, Notepad,
         * dbForge:
         *
         *   named + visible + control              0 - 335 elements   (what this returns)
         *   visible + control                      +23 to +108 more   (Outlook 229 -> 337, Teams 184 -> 275)
         *   (named OR has a value) + visible       +0 or +1
         *
         * So the targeted version - the one that would close the asymmetry - found ONE extra element on two
         * windows out of fourteen, and both were useless: a read-only Document, and an unnamed 13x14
         * checkbox with an empty value. ValueOf skips both anyway, the first for being read-only and the
         * second for being empty. Every element with a value in that sample was already named.
         *
         * Dropping the condition outright is the expensive one and it buys the same nothing: a quarter to a
         * half more elements, against a read that already truncates at 28 and says how many it left out.
         * More elements there is not more information, it is a shorter list of the ones that matter.
         *
         * If an unnamed editable field does show up on some machine, the shape to reach for is
         * `Not(And(Name=="", IsValuePatternAvailable==false))` - equivalent to "named or has a value" and

         * screen is about that. READING A WINDOW is the other path - the model calls it between turns, the

    /* Reading JSON, in the smallest thing that can read one claim response.

       WHY NOT JavaScriptSerializer, WHICH IS ONE LINE. It needs System.Web.Extensions in the Add-Type
       reference list, and that assembly does not exist on .NET Core - so a user who ran the install command
       in PowerShell 7 instead of Windows PowerShell would get a failed Add-Type and NO AGENT AT ALL, not a
       courier that misbehaves. The blast radius decided this: a parser bug stops jobs being claimed, a bad
       assembly reference stops the agent existing.

       So it reads what it has to read and nothing more, and every failure path returns null rather than
       throwing - the caller treats an unreadable answer as "no work", which is the safe reading.

       It is a real parser rather than a regex over the response, because one of the fields is a REPLAY BODY:
       a multi-line blob full of escaped quotes and newlines. Pulling that out with a pattern is how a skill
       replays half of itself. */

    /* ================================================================ the account

       Taking work from the account: what makes "start recording on my PC" possible from a chat that is not
       on this PC.

       The thing it solves is a DIRECTION, not a feature. This agent listens on loopback and nothing on the
       internet can reach it - deliberately, and that is not going to change. So the machine asks: it holds a
       token, long-polls the account for a job, does it, and says how it went. No inbound path to this
       computer exists at any point, and an agent that is not taking work makes no outbound call at all.

       OFF UNTIL SOMEBODY SWITCHES IT ON, and visible in the tray while it is. Everything else this agent
       does happens because something on this machine asked; this is the one thing it would do because a
       service said so, and that difference belongs where the person can see it and turn it off.

       The token is handed over by the app across loopback - the same pairing the extension gets - so nobody
       has to read one, copy one, or keep one anywhere. It is written under LocalApplicationData, which is
       the per-user profile: another standard user on the same PC cannot read it. That is the Windows
       equivalent of the 0600 the macOS agent sets, and it is stated in the docs rather than left to be
       discovered.

       This mirrors the Swift agent's Account and Courier, deliberately and almost line for line. The two
       implementations answering one contract is the whole point of agent/PROTOCOL.md, and a courier that
       drifted would be a Windows machine that silently stopped being drivable. */

    /* The one outward-facing loop: ask for work, do it, say how it went.

       Long-polling rather than a fast poll - the endpoint holds the request open with nothing to say - so
       an idle machine costs a handful of requests a minute rather than twenty, and an idle wait costs no CPU
       at either end. Backs off to a minute on failure, because an agent that hammers a deployment which is
       down makes the outage worse.

       IT WAS A LONG POLL AND IT IS NOT ANY MORE. Asking the endpoint to hold the connection 25 seconds is
       asking for longer than a serverless function is allowed to live, so every idle poll was cut in flight -
       and this loop called each one a failure to reach the account.

       WHY IT IS NOT A LONG POLL ANY MORE, with the arithmetic, because the obvious fix is the wrong one.
       A held request is billed for its whole length, so what matters is function time over wall time:

         wait 25, cut at ~10, then 2s of backoff   10s per 12s   83%   50 function-seconds a minute
         wait 6, ask again at once                  6s per 6s   100%   60   - worse, and this was the plan
         no wait at all, 3s between asks          0.4s per 3.4s  12%    7   - what this does

       Shortening the wait alone makes an idle machine MORE expensive, because the only rest in the old loop
       came from the failure path's sleep. A claim with no wait answers in about four tenths of a second, and
       the sleep between asks is the part that costs nothing at either end. The price is latency: a job
       queued while this machine is asleep waits up to three seconds instead of being picked up mid-poll.
       Once per run, against a seventh of the compute.
