/* What MouseFlow tells people about its MCP server — in one place, because it is said in three.
 *
 * The settings panel where somebody copies the URL, the product page at /mcp, and the documentation all
 * describe the same server. Written three times they would drift, and the drift is not cosmetic: the last
 * time an instruction in this product went stale it sent somebody to a button that did not exist, and they
 * concluded the product was broken rather than that the sentence was.
 *
 * So the tool table lives here, and `mcp/test-mcp.mjs` asserts it against `api/mcp.js` — every tool the
 * server offers is named here, and nothing is named here that the server does not offer. A page that
 * promises a tool nobody implemented is the same class of lie as a button that is not there.
 *
 * What this file is NOT is the tool definitions. Those are derived from the account's own skills by
 * `api/_skill-schema.mjs` and served by `tools/list`; this is prose about the built-in ones.
