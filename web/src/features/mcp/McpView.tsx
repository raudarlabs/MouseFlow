/* /mcp — the page about the part of MouseFlow that is not a screen.
 *
 * Everything else this product does has a page you can look at while it happens: you press Record and watch
 * the timer, you open Skills and see the list. The MCP server is the one component whose whole job is to be
 * used from somewhere else, which means the only way anybody finds out what it can do is by being told. A
 * server nobody can describe is a server nobody adds.
 *
 * PUBLIC, and deliberately. A page explaining how to connect an AI to an account is read by somebody
 * deciding whether to have an account at all, and by an administrator who will never sign in but has to say
 * yes to it. AccountProvider lets this path through its wall, and AppLayout renders it bare — no sidebar, no
 * agent pill: furniture for a product you are already inside, in front of somebody who may not be.
 *
 * Everything factual on it comes from lib/mcp-facts.ts, which the test suite checks against api/mcp.js.
 * A product page that promises a tool the server does not have is the same defect as a button that is not
 * there, and this repository has shipped that one already.
