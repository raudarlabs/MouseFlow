/* Insights: what was actually done on this account, and where the time went.
 *
 * This page is scanned rather than read, so it is built in that order - the shape of the window first (how
 * many runs, how they ended, how long they took), then the things that want a decision (a failure that keeps
 * repeating, a task done fourteen times by hand), then the flat tables. Anything asking for attention is
 * given a shape as well as a number: a bar you can compare without reading it, a colour that means the same
 * thing everywhere on the page.
 *
 * WHOSE NUMBERS. Yours, unless you switch. An owner or an admin of a team can point this page at that whole
 * team - every member's recordings, runs and skills, counted the same way - which is the only place in the
 * product where one person's screen adds up somebody else's work. Three things keep that honest:
 *
 *   the switch is only OFFERED to somebody who owns or administers a team, and the endpoint checks the role
 *     again on every request, because a control that is merely hidden is not a rule;
 *   the scope is written into the address, so a screenshot of "47 runs" can be traced back to whose;
 *   nothing on the team view is content. Counts, durations, application names, skill names - every one of
 *     them was already visible on the team roster. There is no path from here to a colleague's transcript.
 *
 * Two deliberate absences, both honest rather than accidental:
 *
 *  - No chart library. Every mark here is a div or a line of inline SVG. A dependency for eight bars would
 *    be the largest thing in the bundle.
 *  - No derived arithmetic. Everything shown is a field /api/insights sent. Where the stored data cannot
 *    answer a question, the endpoint says so in `gaps` and this page prints it under its own heading -
 *    inventing a plausible number is worse than admitting the gap, because a made-up number gets believed.
