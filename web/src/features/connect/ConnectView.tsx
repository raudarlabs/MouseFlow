/* Connections: the first-run guide for the local agent.
 *
 * Not in the sidebar - it is setup, not a place you work - and reached three ways, each the moment somebody
 * needs it: the account panel, the status pill, and pressing Record with no agent running.
 *
 * The steps are the ones that actually go wrong, in the order they go wrong in. The browser permission has
 * a step of its own because no response header can grant it: reaching 127.0.0.1 from an https page needs
 * the user's Local Network Access permission in Chrome 142+, and that is granted in the browser.
 *
 * TWO PLATFORMS, AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME SHAPE OF FIRST RUN
 *
 * Windows fetches the agent and runs it in memory: nothing installed, nothing to unblock, one line. macOS
 * has no equivalent - a prebuilt binary without an Apple Developer certificate arrives quarantined and
 * Gatekeeper refuses it - so the installer fetches the source and compiles it on the machine, which is never
 * quarantined. That is one extra requirement (Xcode Command Line Tools) and two permissions that only the
 * user can grant, in two different panes of System Settings.
 *
 * So the steps differ, and the difference is not hidden: the third macOS step reports each permission
 * separately and live, from the agent's own /health. Nothing else on this screen can tell somebody why a
 * working agent is returning a black screenshot.
