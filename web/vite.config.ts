/* Uploading source maps needs a Sentry AUTH TOKEN, which is a real secret and therefore lives only in the
 * deployment's environment — never in this repository and never in a checked-in .env. Absent, the whole
 * step is skipped: the build succeeds, the app reports errors exactly as before, and the only thing lost
 * is readable stack traces. A build that FAILED for want of a token would make every contributor without
 * one unable to build the app at all.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM PRODUCTION, and if you are here to put it back, read this first. With the
 * token set, a deployment built in three to five minutes. Without it, twenty-three seconds. Measured on the
 * same commit, and Build CPU Minutes are 87% of what this project costs - so the token is worth roughly
 * eight times the whole rest of the bill.
 *
 * The cost is NOT the upload and NOT the maps. The upload took 0.368s in the build log; generating the maps
 * costs nothing measurable (12.1s against 12.7s locally over four runs, and still 13s with the heap held to
 * 640MB). Nor was it a cold dependency cache, which the log says was restored, nor the public directory,
 * which is 504KB in eight files. What is left is sentryVitePlugin's own work over the output during the
 * bundle phase - it reported its step 4m06s after vite started and 29s before vite finished.
 *
 * So: readable stack traces are available, at four minutes a deploy. If they are wanted back, the thing to
 * try first is narrowing what the plugin looks at (`sourcemaps.assets` pointed at dist/assets/*.js rather
 * than the default sweep) and timing one deployment the same way - an empty commit is enough.
 *
 * SENTRY_ORG and SENTRY_PROJECT come from the same place, for the same reason they are not constants: they
 * name one organisation's project, and this file should not.
