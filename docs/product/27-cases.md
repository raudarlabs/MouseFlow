# 27 — Test cases

A skill answers *do this*. A case answers *is this still true* — and the difference is in what you do with
the answer: a skill that finished is done, a case that finished has a **verdict**, and thirty verdicts in a
row are the only thing that tells anybody their product still works.

![Tests: cases, the row of nights, and the verdict of each](../img/tests.png)

## What a case is

Three things, and nothing else:

| | |
|---|---|
| **the skill** that performs the steps | one made from a goal — see below |
| **its inputs** | exactly what `mouseflow_run` would take |
| **its checks** | what must be true when the run is done, in the same language as [`expect`](25-tests.md) |

That is the whole of `user_case` (`db/021_user_case.sql`). Its name is the fourth thing, and it matters more
than it looks: *"Outlook still sends"* is what somebody reads at nine in the morning next to a red dot.

**The skill has to be one made from a goal.** A recording is replayed with no model in the loop: nothing
reads the screen, so there is nothing to call `expect` with. All three doors refuse it — the page, the tool
and the extension — with that sentence rather than at two in the morning.

**A case runs where its skill runs**, and that is a fact with consequences rather than a detail of plumbing:

| | Desktop skill | Web skill |
|---|---|---|
| Carried out by | the agent on that machine | Chrome with the extension |
| Evidence | `tree` — the accessibility tree | `dom` — the real document |
| Can also check | — | `url_is`, `url_contains`, `count_is` |
| Runs while | that computer is awake and taking work | that Chrome is open with the extension taking work |

So **what a case may assert depends on where it will be checked**, and the refusal arrives when the case is
written: `url_contains` on a desktop skill is not a typo, it is a check nothing could make. The page's own
list of check kinds changes with the skill you pick, for the same reason. See
[13 — The extension](13-extension.md) for the `dom` half and [25 — Checks and tests](25-tests.md) for the
tiers.

## Four verdicts, and `no verdict` is not a failure

The rule is `caseVerdict()` in `api/_case.mjs`, computed from the run's own `outcome` and `checks`, in this
order:

| Verdict | When | Means |
|---|---|---|
| **failed a check** | any check did not hold | the product did not do what it should — **a found defect** |
| **no verdict** | the run did not finish, or made no checks, or a check could not be evaluated | nothing was proven. Not a red |
| **passed · repaired** | everything held, but a step was repaired by the model | not yet stable enough to trust unattended |
| **passed** | the procedure ran and every check held | the only green |

**A failed check comes first, before "the agent did not finish."** A run where a check failed and the agent
then gave up is a defect, not a lost night; hiding it under *no verdict* would lose the one thing the whole
exercise is for.

**And nothing without evidence is ever green.** A run that reached `finish ok: true` and made no checks is
*no verdict*, not *passed* — that path is the most likely way to get a false green in this product, and it
is checked by execution in `api/_test-case.mjs` (more of its cases are about that than about passing).
Likewise a check that *could not be evaluated* (`pass: null`, see [25](25-tests.md)) never counts as one
that held.

**Mixing `no verdict` into red is the expensive mistake.** A night the agent could not open the application
painted the same colour as a found defect gets a report that nobody reads within a week — and with it, the
real defects stop being noticed. So it is grey, and the word says what it means.

The verdict is **not stored**. It is computed wherever it is shown, by one function that the page, the route
and the MCP tools all import — a stored verdict plus a changed rule for reading one is how a report starts
disagreeing with itself, with the old nights coloured by the old rule and nothing on screen saying so.

## The checks are appended to the goal, in words

A case run is an ordinary run whose goal has the checks written under it:

```
reply to Ann that the invoice is approved

THIS IS A TEST CASE. When the goal above is done, and before finish, check every one of these with the
expect tool - one call each, all of them, even when the screen makes the answer look obvious:
1. present "Sent Items" - the reply left the outbox
2. value_contains "Subject" = "Re: invoice" - it answered the right thread
A failed check does not end the run: say what it means and finish. Do not decide any of them by looking at
the picture, and do not skip one because the goal appeared to succeed - a check nobody made is the whole
reason a suite stops being trusted.
```

**Words rather than a field, and that is a deliberate v1 choice.** The assertions could travel as data and
be turned into `expect` calls mechanically, with no model involved — and that is the right shape for v2,
where a check is bound to a step. At the *end* of a run the machine is wherever the run left it: "Sent
Items" may be one click away or may need a folder opened, and only something looking at the screen can tell.
So the model is told to call the tool, and **the verdict is computed from the recorded steps** — not from
what the model said about them. It has nothing to lie with.

## Running one, and running it every night

Both go through the doors that already exist. `mouseflow_run` and `mouseflow_schedule` take `case` where
they take `skill`; the page has **Run now** and **Nightly**.

**Run now queues it, exactly as its schedule would.** It does not drive the run from the page the way
*Create* does — a button that exercises a different path is a button that proves nothing about what happens
at two in the morning. So it becomes a `run_queue` row, the machine takes it within three seconds, and it is
visible on [Activity](26-activity.md) like any other work, with the same Stop.

**Nightly is one button**: 02:00, weekdays, in the browser's own zone. Two in the morning because a case
moves a real mouse, and nobody should be sitting at that machine when it does. It is an ordinary schedule
row (`user_schedule`) with the case's id in its arguments — there is no separate table for "nightly
regression", because pausing, resuming, missed times, the local-zone arithmetic and *three failures in a row
pause it* are all written once already ([24 — Schedules](24-schedules.md)).

### Everything that runs by itself is on this page — 2026-09-22

The third card, **What happens while nobody is watching**, holds two things that used to live on
[Skills](06-skills.md): the strip listing every schedule on the account, and the way to put a **skill** on a
clock. They came here when Skills became the second product's workshop, and they came here rather than onto
a screen of their own because a case is already *a skill plus what must hold, run every night*. A skill on a
clock is the same question with nothing asserted at the end.

So the picker and the strip stand under *New case* rather than above the list: the reading order is what
cases exist, how to write one, and then what out of all of it runs without you. The skill list is the one
`New case` already reads, not a second copy of it.

**The pointer, not a copy.** The queue row and the schedule row carry `args.__case = { id }` and nothing
else: the checks and the inputs are read from the case at the moment the run starts. A case edited this
morning is therefore checked tonight in its new form — the alternative silently tests last month's
assertions with nothing on any screen to say so. The cost of that choice is one query per run, and the fence
it needs is the same as for a deleted skill: *the case was deleted between the ask and the run*.

## The page

Two cards, shaped like [Skills](06-skills.md) and [Activity](26-activity.md): the library of cases with a
seven-row window, and the form that writes one down.

![One case open: its checks, its nights, and the check that did not hold](../img/tests-case.png)

Each row carries **the row of nights** — one dot per run, oldest on the left. Not "the last verdict": one
green dot says nothing about whether a case is stable, while *green, green, grey, grey, grey* says a great
deal, and what it says is about the regression rather than about the product. Beside it: what it runs, how
many checks, when it next runs by itself, and how many times its schedule was missed.

Open a row and it holds the checks in the words the model will read, the schedule's next run with the
condition attached (*runs only while that computer is awake and taking work*), and the runs — each of which
opens into its steps, the `expect` lines in green and red with their evidence, and the frames it kept. Those
are the same components the Create page's history uses (`describe`, `verdict.ts`, `Frames`): a second way of
showing steps would mean somebody used to one reads the other more slowly.

**A deleted skill is named on the row.** *the skill it ran has been deleted — this case cannot run*, rather
than a blank where a name should be: that case fails at the gate every night, and finding out before the
night is the point.

**Eight checks per case** (`EXPECTS_MAX`). Not a technical limit — eight checks at the end of one run is
still something a person reads, thirty is not, and a case with thirty assertions is almost always three
cases wearing one name. The refusal says the number.

## What the tools say

Three tools about cases, and **none of them runs anything**: writing one down, listing them, and reading one
case's history are three questions about cases. *Run this* and *have this run by itself* already existed, and
duplicating them for a new kind of work would mean two pairs of tools that have to change together.

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| `mouseflow_case` | writes one down: name, skill, inputs, checks |
| `mouseflow_cases` | every case, what it checks, its next run, and how the last ten ended |
| `mouseflow_case_results` | one case's history, and for a failure **which check** did not hold, in the case's own words |

`mouseflow_case_results` is the answer to *"did anything break last night?"*, so a failed run prints the
assertion and the evidence beside it rather than a count: `1 check failed` sends somebody looking, and
`"Subject" holds "Re: invoce", not "Re: invoice"` is the bug.

Every list ends with the two sentences that keep a report honest: *no verdict is not a failure*, and *a case
runs only while its machine is awake and taking work*.

## What v1 does not do

- ~~**Checks in the middle of a procedure.**~~ **Done (5-v2, 2026-09-10)** — see *When a check is made*
  below. Not the way the roadmap proposed: a check names a **moment in words**, not a checkpoint number.
- **Repairs.** `passed · repaired` is in the vocabulary and computed, and nothing marks a repaired step yet —
  that is roadmap item 4. It is here because the first repaired run must not arrive in a report as plain
  green.
- **Choosing a machine.** `user_case.machine` is a column and nothing reads it; a case runs wherever the
  account's agent is (roadmap item 7).
- **Editing a case from a chat.** The tool writes one; changing and deleting are on the page.
- **A case over a recording.** Refused, for the reason at the top: a replay has no model to check anything.
- **Selector health on a web replay.** The extension records by selector, so a moved element is already
  survivable — but a selector that matches nothing or several is not yet marked as repaired. That mark is
  roadmap item 4, and the verdict `passed · repaired` is waiting for it.

## When a check is made

By default at the **end** of the run, which is what every case written before 2026-09-10 does and what they
keep doing. A check may instead name the **moment** it belongs to:

| | |
|---|---|
| `check` | `present` |
| `name` | `Sent Items` |
| `why` | the reply left the outbox |
| `after` | **the message has been sent** |

The goal then arrives at the machine in two groups, numbered **continuously across the case** — check 2 is
the second check *of the case*, whichever group it landed in, because that is the number somebody reads in a
red report.

**Why this exists at all.** An outbox is empty after it sends. A check on it at the end of the run is a
different test from a check on it at the moment it mattered, and the first one passes for the wrong reason.
Anything whose subject moves on belongs to a moment: a progress bar, a toast, a draft before it is saved, a
row before it is filed.

**Why a sentence and not a checkpoint number.** Roadmap item 5 said "bound to the plan's checkpoints". That
turned out not to be buildable as written, and the reason is worth keeping: checkpoints reach the browser
driver as a parameter from the Create wizard (`checkpoints` in `desktop-engine.ts`), a **saved skill carries
none**, and the unattended cloud driver is handed `toolsFor(false, …)` — no `reached_checkpoint` at all,
because a checkpoint stops the run until a person answers and on that path there is nobody. A number would
have pointed at nothing. A sentence needs none of it: the **author of the case** names the moment, and
whoever can see the screen decides when it has arrived — the same division of labour that already lets the
model work out where "Sent Items" is.

**And it is not a word without consequences.** Doing every check at the end anyway would look identical in
a report, so it is counted: a bound check with no action of any kind after it was made at the end, and the
case's run says so — *"1 check bound to a moment was made at the end anyway — a weaker test than this case
says"*. It does **not** change the verdict. One late check does not cancel a defect that was found, and
grey-ing out a green run over ordering would be the same false red as collapsing `blocked` into `fail`.
The number appears on the run in the Tests page and in `mouseflow_case_results`; it is absent from the case
list, where the runs' steps are deliberately not shipped.

## Where the reasoning is written

| | |
|---|---|
| `api/_case.mjs` | the four verdicts and their order, the goal text, why the id travels rather than a copy, and why a check's moment is a sentence (`lateBound`, `after`) |
| `api/_test-case.mjs` | executable: no run without evidence is green, and a failed check is never hidden |
| `api/cases.js` | the page's door, and why the list asks the database for a count instead of shipping steps |
| `api/_queue.mjs` | one door into the queue, so *Run now* refuses in the same words the tools do |
| `db/021_user_case.sql` | why the assertions are a field of the case and not of its schedule |
| `web/src/features/tests/TestsView.tsx` | the two cards, the row of nights, and one button for nightly |
| `web/src/features/tests/verdicts.ts` | why `no verdict` is grey |
| `docs/QA-ROADMAP.md` | item 5, and the six items still open |

## The machine that tests own

A regression run needs a desktop nobody is typing at. One mouse per machine is the whole constraint, and
every number below follows from it.

**The recipe.**

1. A Windows VM — Hyper-V, Parallels, whatever the host runs. It needs a **real desktop session**: a
   regression clicks things, so the screen must not be locked and the session must not be disconnected.
   (An RDP window that is closed rather than signed out leaves the session running, which is what you
   want; locking it is what you do not.)
2. Install the agent there and let it **autostart**, so a reboot does not end the night's run.
3. Attach that machine to the account with its **own** device token, labelled for the machine — see
   [09 — Connections](09-connections.md).
4. Start the agent with **`-RequireKey`** and paste its key once in that VM's browser. This is the machine
   the key exists for: loopback is reachable by every session on it, and a QA machine is precisely the one
   with more than one.
5. **Pin every case to it.** A case carries the name of the machine it may run on; a job queued for it is
   only ever handed to a claimer reporting that name. A case pinned to the VM never runs on your laptop,
   which is the point — a nightly regression that steals your pointer at 02:00 is a regression nobody keeps.

**What this costs, in arithmetic rather than adjectives.** One mouse means cases run **serially**. At about
two minutes a case, 100 cases is roughly 3.5 hours — fine for a night. 1000 cases is not, and no amount of
tuning changes that: the answer is a **second VM with a second label**, and the cases split between them.
Plan for that before you have 400 cases, not after.

**Stopping it** is `mouseflow_stop`, which stops what that machine is doing.

**Where the pin is honoured.** In the queue, when the job is taken — so a case edited this morning does not
change the machine of a job already queued tonight. If a deployment cannot hold the pin yet (the column is
added by `db/022_queue_machine.sql`, which is applied by hand), queueing **says so in the answer** rather
than quietly running the case wherever: a case you believe ran on the VM and did not is worse than one that
did not run.
