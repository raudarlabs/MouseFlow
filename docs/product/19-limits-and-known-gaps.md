# 19 — Limits and known gaps

Three different kinds of thing, kept apart on purpose: what cannot work, what has not been verified, and
what is currently wrong.

---

## Inherent limits

These are not bugs and no amount of work inside the current design removes them.

### Coordinate recording (the desktop half)

- **Absolute coordinates.** A recording is pixel positions on the screen it was made on. Move the target
  window, resize it, change resolution or plug in a second monitor and the replay clicks whatever now sits at
  those pixels. Aiming by `#ctx` name corrects a *re-laid-out neighbour*, not a moved window.
- **Display scaling.** Input injection happens in physical pixels; a recording made at one DPI scale replays
  wrong at another.
- **A taskbar click is named but not aimed.** Since 0.9.9 the transcript says which icon was clicked; the
  replay still clicks the recorded coordinate. Aiming by name works by hit-testing the point and looking
  among the siblings of whatever is there, and on the taskbar the point hit-tests to `Shell_TrayWnd` - the
  whole window - whose siblings are other top-level windows. So a taskbar rearranged between recording and
  replay opens the wrong application, silently. It was equally true before naming worked; what is new is
  that the transcript now shows the name, which makes the gap easy to mistake for closed.
- **Windows integrity levels cut both ways.** A medium-integrity agent cannot inject into an elevated window
  **and cannot see input while one has focus**. A recording made over an admin app is silently incomplete —
  the events never arrive, so nothing downstream can detect the hole. The UAC secure desktop is unreachable
  either way.
- **macOS has all twenty-one tools as of 0.16.0 — written, and mostly not yet watched.** Everything added
  from 0.10.0 to 0.12.0 was Windows only for six releases; `capture_window`, `clipboard_read`,
  `clipboard_write`, `open_url`, `open_app`, `read_window`, `find_element`, `scroll_to`, `drag`,
  `refresh_page` and `wait_for_window` all exist on the Swift agent now, and the by-name refusals are gone
  with them. **What that sentence does not say is that they have been run.** They typecheck, the contract
  suite holds them against the Windows implementation, and that compares text and shapes rather than
  behaviour. The three most likely to be wrong on a real Mac, and why:
  - **`read_window` and `find_element`** walk the AX tree breadth-first under three bounds at once (1500
    nodes, depth 12, 2.5s, plus a 4s messaging timeout on the application). Those numbers were chosen from
    the Windows measurements, not measured here. An application that answers slowly will return a short
    list rather than a wrong one, which is the safe direction, but the list may be shorter than it should be.
  - **`capture_window`** uses `SCContentFilter(desktopIndependentWindow:)`, which is better than the Windows
    answer — it photographs the window whatever is in front of it, and unlike `PrintWindow` it does not fail
    on hardware-accelerated surfaces. It needs Screen Recording, and a region capture is at point
    resolution (1 image pixel = 1 screen point), not backing-store resolution.
  - **The sign of the horizontal wheel is a reasoned guess.** On Windows the convention is documented:
    positive `WM_MOUSEHWHEEL` is right. `CGEventTypes.h` does not state one, so the agent follows
    `NSEvent.scrollingDeltaX`, where positive is left, and both halves — the recorder tap and the injector —
    ask one function (`Sideways`) so they cannot disagree with each other. If it is mirrored, it is mirrored
    consistently and one line flips both. **Check:** scroll sideways during a recording in anything with a
    horizontal list, and read whether the transcript says "Scroll Left" or "Scroll Right".
- **A single character typed is invisible to the change detector.** The screen fingerprint is 64x36 grey
  cells, so each one is a 30x30 average: fifteen characters move four cells and one character moves none.
  An action that types one character can therefore be reported as having changed nothing. Nothing on this
  grid can fix that; a finer grid would cost what the fingerprint exists to avoid.
- **A short name that is content cannot be told from a label.** From 0.13.0 a control name longer than 60
  characters is not recorded — measured: the longest name on anything a person presses was 43, and everything
  above 60 in a three-application sample was content. What the rule cannot catch is content that is SHORT: a
  spell-check menu named `Spelling, сторят` carries one typed word in sixteen characters, and nothing in the
  string says whether that is a label or somebody's spelling. Recorded as a name, like any label.
- **Window and page titles are still recorded in full**, minus the query string. A chat title carries the
  other person's name, an email window carries the subject. That is deliberate — the transcript segments the
  work by window, and redacting titles would leave a recording with no structure at all — but it is worth
  knowing before a recording is shared.
- **An application can stop answering its accessibility interface, and then naming does not work at all.**
  Measured: dbForge Studio described itself in 187ms one hour and did not reply at all the next, from any
  thread. `read_window` and `find_element` give it four seconds, then mute that window for a minute and say
  so — the screenshot is the fallback, and the model is told to use it. At most three such searches may be
  outstanding, because a search that never returns keeps its thread.
- **`scroll_to` takes a single-word name.** The wire gives an action one field that may contain spaces and
  `find_element` spends it on the name it is looking for, so a multi-word target is cut at the first space.
  Said in the tool description rather than silently.
- **A captured picture stays on the machine.** `capture_window` writes a PNG under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MouseFlow\captures` (pruned to 200 files and 7 days) and puts it on the clipboard. That is
  enough to paste it into a document, which is what the failing scenario needed, but the bytes never reach
  the run's record on the account — so a report on our side cannot show the picture, only name the path.
  Carrying attachments up to the account needs a table, an upload path and a size cap, and is a piece of
  work of its own rather than a corner of this one.
- **The self-window guard protects a process, not a window.** Windows Terminal keeps every window of a
  profile in one process, so a SECOND Terminal window is refused along with the one hosting the agent. The
  refusal says so and names the way round (a different terminal application, or autostart, where the agent
  has no terminal at all). Erring this way is deliberate: the alternative is failing to protect the window
  that matters.
- **An Electron window still names nothing on macOS, and Chrome now does.** Measured on this Mac with the
  0.16.0 `read` action: a Google Chrome window answers with 27 named things — toolbar, bookmarks bar, Back,
  Forward (correctly reported disabled), Reload, the profile button — while the Claude desktop app answers
  with exactly two, both the size of the window: a group and an `AXWebArea` with no children. `awaken()`
  sets `AXManualAccessibility` and falls back to `AXEnhancedUserInterface` **only when the first is not
  understood**, and an Electron app appears to accept the first and ignore it, so the fallback never fires.
  Setting both unconditionally is the obvious fix and is deliberately not done: `AXEnhancedUserInterface` is
  VoiceOver's own signal and AppKit changes window-geometry behaviour under it, which is why window managers
  toggle it off around every move they make. This is the same shape as the Chrome tab-strip gap below, and
  it affects `#ctx` naming during a recording as well as `read_window`.
- **macOS captures one display.** ScreenCaptureKit takes the display the cursor is on. Bounds checking still
  uses the union of all displays, because a click on the second monitor is a legitimate click even when the
  agent cannot see it.
- **macOS `/shot` and `/pulse` need macOS 14+.** `CGWindowListCreateImage` is *unavailable* on macOS 15, not
  merely deprecated, and cannot be kept behind an `#available`. `capture_window` is on the same floor and
  says so rather than failing obscurely.
- **Until 0.19.0 a modifier stayed pressed after every chord, on macOS, for the whole machine.** This is the
  most consequential defect found so far and it was found by measurement, not by reading. A listen-only
  `CGEventTap` printing the flags of events carrying the agent's mark, after one `press_key` with a modifier:

  ```
  keyDown   mods=Cmd  text=""     <- the chord itself, as asked
  mouseDown mods=Cmd              <- the next click was a Command-click
  scroll    mods=Cmd              <- the next scroll was Command-scroll, i.e. zoom
  keyDown   mods=Cmd  text="z"    <- the next typing was Command+Z, i.e. undo
  ```

  `CGEventSource(stateID: .hidSystemState)` gives a new event the *current* modifier state, and only
  `press_key` set flags explicitly. The state also latched globally: `flagsState(.combinedSessionState)`
  returned `Cmd` indefinitely, so the person's own keyboard was affected too. Typing `mouse test4` after
  Command+S therefore sent Command+M (minimise), Command+O, Command+U, **Command+S (save again — which is
  where the "replace this file?" dialog came from)**, Command+E, Command+T. Nothing reached the field, macOS
  beeped at the combinations that do nothing, and the model's "the typing didn't land" was **correct**.
  Fixed three ways: explicit flags on every posted event, a chord that presses and releases its modifiers as
  keys (chosen by measuring four candidate releases), and `type()` releasing anything still held first.
  **A recording now starts by releasing them as well, and that half is about a promise:** a letter is only
  named when it arrives under Command or Control, so with Command latched every keystroke a person made
  would have arrived as a chord and **the letter would have been named**. The rule is held by an executable
  test that runs the chord order without posting anything.
- **A modifier held by anything else still changes what an action does, and `releaseModifiers` is a blunt
  answer to it.** From 0.20.0 both agents release whatever is held before a chord, before typing, at
  recording start, and at both ends of a replay — because a modifier latched by another application, a stuck
  physical key, or an agent that died mid-chord is *added* to whatever was asked for: `key=w` becomes close
  window, `key=q` quits, `key=delete` in Finder means move to Trash, and `key=r ctrl=1` under a latched
  Shift becomes the hard-reload `refresh` uses. All of those returned "done". The cost of the cure is that
  it cannot tell a stale latch from a finger on a key, so a person physically holding Shift while a run
  types loses it, and there is no field to opt out. During a run that is the right trade — the run must do
  what it was asked, not what somebody's finger made of it — but it is a real behaviour, not a detail.
- **Modified pointer gestures: recorded and replayed on macOS from 0.21.0; Windows and the action grammar
  are not done.** A Shift-click, Command-click, Option-drag or Command+scroll made by a person on a Mac is
  now recorded (`mods=` on the `#ctx` line), narrated (`Shift-clicked "Report.pdf"`, `Alt-dragged 202px`,
  `Cmd-scrolled down 2 notches`) and replayed as the same gesture. **Verified end to end on a real Mac**, in
  both directions: an injected Shift-click recorded as `mods=Shift`, and a replayed Option-drag posted the
  flag on its press, its movement and its release, with the session's modifier state clean afterwards.

  Settled by measurement, against the design's own expectation: on macOS the flags on a posted mouse event
  are **sufficient** — a window reporting what it saw showed `NSEvent.modifierFlags = Alt` identically for
  an event sent with flags only and one sent with the key physically held. So no modifier key is pressed.
  The same measurement found the other half: those flags **latch** the session state exactly as a keyboard
  chord does, so the replay releases them when a gesture closes.

  **Windows caught up in 0.23.0, and it was verified by running rather than by reading.** The recording
  half writes `mods=` on a button-down and on a scroll and on nothing else; the replay performs the gesture
  by holding the real key, because a Windows mouse event has no field for a modifier — see PROTOCOL.md for
  the three consequences that follow from that difference. Checked on this machine with a window that
  reports the modifiers it was given: a plain click arrived as `down -, up -`, the same body with one
  `#ctx mods=Shift` line above it arrived as `down Shift, up Shift`, `mods=Ctrl+Shift` as
  `down Ctrl+Shift, up Ctrl+Shift`, a Ctrl+scroll as `wheel Ctrl`, and an Alt-drag held Alt from the press
  through two movements to the release. The recorder was driven the same way — `Capture()` called directly,
  because the hook drops injected mouse events on purpose — and produced a `#ctx` line whose only field is
  `mods=Ctrl` for the scroll, which is the case a four-field guard used to swallow whole.

  **One defect this found that reading had not.** The wire was written correctly, `ParseCtx` read it
  correctly, and the value died in between: the pending context is copied onto its event **field by field**,
  and the new field was not in the list. Every modified gesture would have replayed unmodified and reported
  a clean run — the exact failure the change exists to remove, reintroduced one line below the fix. It
  survived a compile, a 431-test suite and a code read, and fell out of the first round trip that was
  actually executed.

  **The action grammar caught up in the same release.** `click`, `drag` and `scroll` take `modifiers`, a
  list of physical keys, and the agent runs an asked-for gesture through the same code as a replayed one -
  on Windows by putting the value on the event `Emit` already knows how to hold. Verified on this machine
  against a watcher window in a separate process (the agent correctly refuses to drive its own): a plain
  click arrived `down -, up -`, `mods=Shift` arrived `down Shift, up Shift`, a Shift-double-click carried it
  on **both** presses, all three notches of a Ctrl+scroll arrived `wheel Ctrl`, and an Alt-drag held Alt to
  the release with nothing left held afterwards.

  Two things that had to be right and are only visible by reading. `mods=` is written **before** `name=` on
  the click wire, because `name=` takes the rest of the line and a field after it becomes part of the label.
  And on macOS the flags travel **through** `send(_:flags:)` rather than being assigned to the event before
  it: that function sets `event.flags = flags` unconditionally, defaulting to `[]`, so assigning and then
  calling `send(event)` would set the modifier and immediately clear it - sending the plain gesture while
  the code above looked correct.

  **Still open:** a modifier pressed or released **mid-drag** is recorded on neither platform, so copying in
  File Explorer by starting a drag and then pressing Ctrl records as a plain drag, which is a move. And the
  macOS half of the action grammar is **written, not run** - swiftc is absent on the Windows machine this
  was written on, and `check-swift.mjs` skips itself silently there.
- **Modified pointer gestures could be neither performed nor recorded before 0.21.0, on either platform.** Shift-click to extend a
  selection, Command-click to open a link in a background tab, Option-drag to copy, Command+scroll to zoom:
  `click` reads only `button`, `double` and `name`; `drag` and `scroll` have no modifier field; and the bare
  modifier keys are not in the key table, so the chord cannot be composed by hand either. Recording is the
  half that surprises: a recording of a person doing any of them replays as the **unmodified** gesture and
  reports a clean run — not because the replay strips the modifier, but because the recording never saw it.
  The tap does not subscribe to `flagsChanged`, `Recorder.capture` takes no flags, and the transcript's
  five-column format has no modifier column. Fixing the replay alone would change nothing.
- **The "already open" list was in screen pixels while everything else was in the picture's.** Fixed in
  0.18.0. `/windows` reports rectangles in screen pixels and `openList` printed them as such, one paragraph
  below a screenshot the model clicks in — and on a 1680x1050 Mac the shot goes out 1280 wide, so the two
  differed by 31%. A watched run said so out loud: *"the reported coordinates are offset from the
  screenshot"*, and spent two turns on it. The window reading itself was **verified exact** by drawing the
  agent's reported rectangles onto the real screenshot — every box landed on its element — so the list was
  the half that disagreed. It is converted now, by the same formula everything else uses.
- **A save panel is not a window that can be activated, and it was being offered as one.** Measured with a
  panel on screen: the visible sheet belongs to the *application*, while the separate "Open and Save Panel
  Service" keeps windows of its own, none on screen, and one of them carries the same title AND SORTS
  FIRST. So `activate_window {title: "Открыть"}` matched the scaffolding and got "macOS refused to bring
  Open and Save Panel Service (Pages) forward" — which reads as a fault in macOS and is not one. From
  0.18.0 the off-screen windows of that service are dropped from the list, so the title reaches the real
  sheet. Only the off-screen ones: a panel shown as its own window (`runModal` rather than `begin`) is real
  and must stay aimable.
- **The model does not call `read_window` on its own, so the driver calls it.** Measured across two runs
  after the tool was written, its description rewritten, and two prompt rules added telling the model to use
  it: `read_window` and `find_element` were called **zero times in both**, and both runs stalled on exactly
  what those tools answer. From 0.17.0 the rule is code rather than advice — when a turn reports that
  nothing on screen moved, the driver appends a read of the front window to the next turn's actions and puts
  the answer beside the next screenshot. Both drivers do it at the same moment, from the same
  `shouldPeek(still)` in the brain. **It is not a tool_result** — no `tool_use` block matches it, and the
  API refuses a result with no call — and it is not written into the run log, because the user reads their
  own intentions there. Cost: one accessibility read (0.3–2.5s) on a turn that already went to waste,
  against ~6s for the model turn it saves. **Whether it changes the model's behaviour is not yet measured** —
  it is written and tested, and the next run on a real machine is the observation.
- **`read_window` reports what is in a field; a recording still never does.** From 0.17.0 the two paths are
  separate rules rather than one. A RECORDING takes no typed text on either platform — it is stored,
  exported into a SKILL.md, downloaded and forwarded, and the promise printed on the record screen is about
  that. READING A WINDOW does report it: the model calls it between turns, the answer lives one turn and is
  stored nowhere (a run row holds `{tool, input, ms}`; an action's output never reaches it), and the
  screenshot the model is sent every turn already contains the same text. Measured cause: a 198s run typed
  one file name **four times by three mechanisms** — type, type again, then via the clipboard — because
  nothing could say whether it had landed; nine of that block's fourteen steps were repeats, about sixty
  seconds. Values are clipped to 80 characters, because the value of a document body is the document.
  **A password field is exempt on every path**, checked before anything is read, and it is shown as
  `= (password, not read)` rather than as nothing — an empty field shows nothing too, and a model that
  reads a password box as "empty" will type into it. Both facts were found by probing a live window with
  one plain and one secure field, not by reading the code:
  `text field "" … = "plain-visible-value"; secure text field "" … = (password, not read)`.
  **The Windows half is run now** — `ValuePattern.ValueProperty` with `IsPassword` and `IsReadOnly`
  excluded, driven against a real Notepad: `document "Text editor" at 68,139 1428x827 = "## 1. Primary
  Target Самый высококонверсионный сегмент…"`, clipped at eighty characters with the ellipsis in place.
  **And the asymmetry that came with it is measured rather than assumed.** The Windows search requires a
  non-empty Name, so an entirely unnamed field is missed there where macOS lists it. Over fourteen live
  windows the targeted relaxation — "named OR has a value" — added **at most one element**, and on the two
  windows where it added one it was a read-only Document and an unnamed 13×14 checkbox with an empty
  value, both of which `ValueOf` skips anyway. Every value-bearing element in that sample was already
  named. Dropping the Name condition outright costs 25–50% more elements (Outlook 229 → 337, Teams
  184 → 275) against a read that already truncates at 28. So it stays, and the reason is now a number:
  see `NamedAndVisible` for the shape to use if a machine ever does show one.
- **A click on nothing named used to be a coordinate and nothing else.** `clicked in the page, at 99,577`
  was the whole of what a reader got, and a step cannot be placed from that. The cause was not a failed
  read: measured on a live Chrome window, the element under the pointer is an unnamed group, the first named
  ancestor is the document title, and **the only named element containing the point is a `Text` node
  carrying the paragraph being read**. Looking harder would have recorded content.
  From 0.24.0 the step carries a **landmark** instead — the label of the nearest control and which side
  of it the point fell on — so the same step reads `clicked in the page just below "Address Bar", at
  99,577`. The coordinate stays, because a replay and an edit both need it; what changed is that it is no
  longer the only thing known.
  The set of types that may be a landmark is measured, not chosen: over twelve live windows `Button` has 420
  instances with a median name of 11 characters and `Edit` 504 with a median of 4, while `Text` runs to 432
  characters and `Group` to 326 — so those two, with `ListItem` and `DataItem`, are excluded. Verified by
  running it against every open window: Teams answered `Favorites`, `Chats`, `Translate`; Outlook `View
  request`, `Quick actions`; Explorer `Address Bar`, `More options`; and not one answer was a sentence of
  content. The whole window is read once per two seconds and cached, so a burst of clicks in one window costs
  one read (61–342 ms measured) rather than one per click.
  **The macOS half is written, not run** — swiftc is absent on the Windows machine this was written on,
  and it is held by cross-platform pins rather than by a build.
- **A short name that is content still gets recorded, on both platforms.** From 0.16.0 the macOS agent drops
  any element name over 60 characters and writes `namelen=` instead, which is what Windows has done since
  0.11.0 — the accessibility name of a message element *is* the message. The rule is a length, so it cannot
  catch a spell-check item called "Spelling, сторят", which carries one typed word in sixteen characters.
  Nothing measured separates that from a label.

### Element recording (the extension)

- **No native applications.** Nothing outside a browser tab.
- **No `chrome://` or Web Store pages** — Chrome blocks injection.
- **CSS `:hover` never lights up.** The browser drives that from the real pointer and no synthetic event can
  reach it. The one difference from the desktop agent that cannot be closed from inside a page.
- **Canvas app surfaces have nothing to anchor to.** The Excel Online grid draws itself into a canvas; its
  ribbon and dialogs are ordinary DOM and do work.
- **`isTrusted` is false.** Most apps including React and Vue are driven correctly, but a site that checks
  `isTrusted` will ignore synthetic events. The fix is `chrome.debugger`, at the cost of a *"MouseFlow started
  debugging this browser"* infobar in every tab.

### Both halves

- **No typed text, anywhere.** Deliberate; see [17 — Privacy](17-privacy-security.md). The consequence is
  that a recording containing typing cannot be replayed faithfully, and the replay says so as `unplayable`.
- **A recording holds input, not outcome.** Nothing stored says whether anything on the screen did what was
  wanted. Replaying it is the only way to find out.
- **Electron applications name almost nothing** in either accessibility tree.
- **Safari cannot reach the agent.** It has no Local Network Access permission to grant and blocks the
  loopback hop outright. The desktop half is Chrome/Edge in practice.
- ~~**No agent authentication.**~~ **Closed in two passes, and the entry was wrong by the end of the
  first.** `-AllowOrigin` is *enforced*, not echoed — empty now means "this product's own pages and
  loopback", not "anybody", so no remote page can drive the agent. And from agent **0.29.0** a **pairing
  key** can be required on everything but `/health` (`-RequireKey` / `--require-key`; see
  [10 — Agent protocol](10-agent-protocol.md)).

  What is left is **stated rather than hidden**: with the key off — the default — a process running as
  **the same user** can still drive the agent. That is not a hole a key can close, because such a process
  can call `SendInput` itself and read the account file; a key would be an obstacle only to the honest.
  What the key does close is the case that is *not* the same user: a second logged-in session, fast user
  switching, Screen Sharing, a service under its own account — none of which can post events into
  somebody else's desktop, all of which can reach loopback. That is the case a machine owned by tests
  actually has, and it is why the key is off by default and on for a QA machine.
- **The rate limits are per serverless instance**, so the real ceiling is the stated number times however many
  are warm. They stop a stuck client, not a determined caller.
- **`find_repeated` matches identical goal text.** Two goals differing by one name are not clustered.
- **Time saved cannot be reported.** Nothing holds how long the same task takes by hand.

---

### What was picked was never in the recording, and now the draft asks

A click carries the name of what it landed on, and sometimes what it landed on is the **page itself**.
Measured on one live recording: the button ` Add filter` on 2Checkout, and then three clicks reported as
`type=document`, `control="Order search"` — the name of the *document*, because the filter that opened had
no accessibility name on anything inside it. Which filter was chosen is not in the recording and cannot be.

Until this, those three clicks became three steps of a skill draft: `click "Order search"` three times over
— a line a model reading the screen can do nothing with, standing exactly where the only real decision was
made. The complaint was the right one: step 5 said `Click " Add filter"` and never asked *which* filter.

**So the draft asks, once, where the question belongs.** A run of page-body clicks is folded away and the
named click that opened it carries a fillable line instead: `click " Add filter", then pick the product
filter`. It is an offer, not a question — left empty the step stays exactly as it was, and nothing is
blocked. Whoever made the recording is still on screen, which is the same bargain the typing blanks strike.

Two limits stay, and both are deliberate. **It only asks where somebody opened something**: a click on the
page body is ordinary — 144 such runs on a 6,705-step recording, mostly clicks on empty space — and
requiring a named click immediately before brings that to 29, and to 2 on the recording that prompted this,
which are the two that matter. A pick with no opener is left as an ordinary step rather than turned into a
question about nothing. And **the container test reads a localised string**: `type` arrives from UI
Automation as `LocalizedControlType`, so on a non-English Windows the word will not be `document` and no
line will be offered. That fails towards silence, never towards a wrong step, and it is the same trade the
agent already makes when it decides what counts as a landmark.

### The site is in the transcript and not yet in the time split

A desktop recording of a browser carries `context.url` on the clicks the agent could resolve — measured on
one live recording: **18 of 23 clicks**, giving `secure.2checkout.com`, `desk.zoho.com`,
`salesiq.zoho.com`. Until this was found, nothing read it: every reader looked for `url` on the event
itself, which is where the extension writes it and where the desktop agent does not. So a window titled
`Dashboard - Google Chrome` was all anybody saw of an hour on 2Checkout.

The **transcript** now names the site on every stretch, and the **search index** now finds recordings by it.
Both work because they need the site as a *name*: the transcript keeps the last address seen in that window
and carries it forward, since the page did not change between two clicks or an event would have said so.

**The per-application time split still says `chrome`,** and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. It
attributes *duration*, and the address is on 18 events out of 1598 — the other 1580 are pointer movement. A
per-event rule would give `secure.2checkout.com` a few seconds and leave `chrome` with the hours: a row that
is worse than its absence. The pattern would flicker the same way, `chrome -> secure.2checkout.com -> chrome`
on every click. Doing it properly needs the sticky derivation the transcript uses, expressed as a
last-non-null window function over each recording's events — real work, and worth doing, and not worth
half-doing.

### One application, two names, and only half of it is fixable here

An application is named by whatever the platform reports, and the two halves report differently: the Windows
agent gives the **process** name (`chrome`), the macOS agent gives the **display** name (`Google Chrome`).

Half of that turned out not to be this problem at all. `claude` and `Claude` are the *same string* in two
cases — on the live account they were two rows of 201 and 37 minutes — and folding case cannot merge
anything that was not already one thing. So application names are now lowercased where they are derived, in
both `api/_digest.mjs` and `api/insights.js`, exactly as origins already were. The digest version went 1 → 2
and every row recomputed; the totals were unchanged to the digit, which is the check that mattered.

**`chrome` against `Google Chrome` remains**, and is deliberately left alone. Those are different strings,
so any fix is a table somebody types: it has to be right for every application anybody records, and one
wrong row silently merges two real applications into one — a worse failure than two rows a reader can see
and add up. Worth doing properly, since the agent knows which platform it is on and could emit both names,
and not worth doing by inference here. Until then the per-application split counts them separately, and a
process recorded on both machines is not recognised as repeated.

### The Dashboard drills into time, and not yet into anything else

A slice of the Dashboard lives in the address and can be sent to somebody: the window, as `?days=7` or
`?from=…&to=…`, and a column of the day chart writes one day into it. That is the whole of the drill-down
today. **There is no `?app=chrome`** — narrowing every number on the page to one application would mean
threading a filter through ten separate queries, and the honest question underneath it has not been answered
yet: a run whose steps carry no page belongs to no application, so "runs in Chrome" is a definition before it
is an implementation, and a filter that silently dropped those runs would report a smaller, confident,
wrong number. `Where the time went` and `Processes that look alike` name the applications; nothing yet
narrows the page to one.

## Not verified

"It works" and "it was tested" are different claims, and this section keeps them apart.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Web app, Windows agent (pre-0.8.2) | **Verified** on real machines. 94 contract checks, plus suites for the transcript, the split of oversized recordings, the reconciliation and the gallery. |
| Windows tray + held recordings (0.8.2) | **Verified** on a real Windows machine, 2026-08-21 — items 1–5 of the DEBUG-WINDOWS checklist. |
| Windows: naming rate at 0.8.2 | **Not re-measured.** The 70.8% / 146-of-151 baseline predates the tray work. |
| Windows: the tray's failure paths | **Untested rather than disproved** — a tray that fails to appear, a held recording surviving a restart of the agent, the 409 that refuses to record over one. |
| macOS: recording, `#ctx` naming, `/shot`, `/pulse`, `/windows`, both permissions, the permission self-recovery, the menu bar, the held-recording handover, a Developer ID rebuild keeping the grants | **Verified** on a real Mac (macOS 26.5, arm64), 2026-08-20 and 2026-08-21. |
| macOS: **replay, and aiming by name** | **Never observed working.** |
| macOS: **the eleven actions added in 0.16.0** | **Written, typechecked, never run.** `swiftc -typecheck` passes and the contract suite holds each against the Windows implementation — which compares text and shapes, not behaviour. Nothing here has photographed a window, read an AX tree under a deadline, or scrolled sideways on a real Mac. |
| macOS: **the horizontal wheel's sign** | **Reasoned, not measured.** `CGEventTypes.h` does not state one; the agent follows `NSEvent.scrollingDeltaX` (positive is left). Recorder and injector share one constant, so an error is mirrored consistently and costs one line. |
| macOS: **the two recording leaks closed in 0.16.0** | Names over 60 characters and query strings in address-shaped window titles no longer reach a recording. **The rule is checked by the suite; the effect on a real recording is not re-measured.** |
| macOS: Chrome's tab strip | Measured and **still nameless**: the hit test returns an unnamed group, climbing finds nothing, and the bounded child descent reached no tabs either (8 tab clicks, 0 named). The tabs must live in another branch, likely an `AXTabGroup` under the window. Finding it needs an AX-tree inspection of a real Chrome, not another guess. |
| The OpenAI provider path | **Written, never run from here.** No `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the deployment. Structured so a wrong assumption fails loudly with the upstream's own message rather than silently degrading. |
| Antivirus / EDR behaviour | **Untested.** A global mouse hook plus `SendInput` looks exactly like a RAT. |
| **The Windows agent at 0.9.2** | **Written, never run there.** The step loop (`?worker=step`) and the crash reporter (`?worker=crash`, `/crash-test`) were both written on a Mac and have not executed on Windows once. The contract suite holds them against the macOS implementation, but that compares **text, not behaviour** — it would pass an implementation that returns the right shapes and moves no mouse. |
| The Windows worker installer | **Written, never run.** No Windows on this machine, so `mcp/install-worker-windows.ps1` has not been executed. Its contract is held against the macOS installer by the suite — token shape, no-echo prompt, Node floor, the three settings, status and uninstall — but that compares text, not behaviour. Unlike launchd there is no KeepAlive: a Startup-folder item is started once at sign-in and not restarted, which the script says out loud. **It now matters less than it did**: nobody needs the worker for a goal skill since 0.9.0. |
| Windows `/account` and the courier | **Verified on a real PC, 2026-08-23.** Attached from the app, `/health` answered `"linked":true,"taking":true,"platform":"windows"`, and a recording was started and stopped from a chat over MCP — the full path, chat to account to queue to the machine and back. It failed to compile on the first attempt: `HookInstalled` was declared a second time and `Add-Type` refused the whole block, which is the loud failure rather than a quiet one. `agent/check-csharp.mjs` runs in `npm test` now and catches that class of mistake. |
| Team invitation emails | **Configured, not yet observed delivering.** `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` are set on production against the verified domain `kuswise.com`, so the send path is live — but no invitation has been watched arriving in a real inbox yet, and "the request returned 200" and "it landed in an inbox" are different claims. The message builder and the unconfigured path are covered by the suite. Invitations work either way: the row is the invitation, and if a send fails the screen says so with the provider's own words. |
| The team dashboard at a large team | **Not measured past a handful of accounts.** `/api/insights?team=` unrolls every event of every recording for every member in one read-only transaction, and it is already the most expensive read in the product for one account. A 200-person team — the schema's cap — has never been tried, and the rate limit (30/min) counts requests, not accounts. If it becomes slow, the fix is to bound the per-application unrolling by member count rather than to raise a timeout. |

### The stop-inside-a-wait path is written and not observed

A wait can last two minutes, so the agent asks `?worker=state&id=` every third look at the screen and
abandons the turn if the job is no longer `claimed`. That code has **never run**, because the model did not
call `wait` in any of the verification runs — and it cannot be made to. Asking for a goal that ought to need
waiting is not the same as getting a `wait`, and a path proven by a test that forces the call is a path
proven against the test rather than against the model.

The cancellation that *was* measured took a different route: the run was between steps, and the row was
tidied in 0.2 s.

### `api/mcp.js` still has no executable coverage

This is the honest headline. The route that queues work, hands it to a machine, drives the loop and closes
the job is checked by **regexes over its own source** and by nothing that runs it.

Four bugs shipped from it in one day, and every one was found by watching a real run rather than by a suite:

| | |
|---|---|
| A cancelled job kept its conversation | so the next claim resumed something the user had stopped |
| A log entry written under `q_q_…` | the queue id prefixed twice |
| A three-minute run recorded as eleven seconds | the wrong timestamp closed it |
| A helper declared after the branch that called it | which answered a cancelling agent with HTTP 500 |

The regexes now guard all four, which is worth something and is not the same thing as coverage: each one was
written after the fact, from a bug already understood. A regex cannot find the fifth.

What it would take is a harness that stands a queue up, claims from it, steps through a scripted loop and
cancels part-way — the same shape as the existing suites, against a route that currently has none.

## Defects found while writing this documentation

Reported rather than fixed, because documenting was the task. Each is small and each has a named site.

### 0. There was no backup of the database at all - **closed, except the rehearsal**

Asked as a question - *"do we even have backups? if it falls over do we lose everything?"* - and the answer
was yes, everything. The only thing standing between the account and total loss was Neon's six-hour history
window on the free plan: no snapshots, no schedule, nothing outside the project, no cron in `vercel.json`,
no `pg_dump` anywhere in the repository. Six hours of undo, inside the system it was supposed to insure.

Closed by `scripts/backup.mjs` and `.github/workflows/backup.yml` - a daily encrypted dump into object
storage outside Neon, with the reasoning in
[20 - Operations](20-operations.md#backup-and-restore). **What is still open is the part that makes it
a backup rather than a file: nobody has restored one yet.** A dump that has never been through `pg_restore` is a hope. The
rehearsal is a monthly job away and needs a Neon API key, which is a decision rather than a line of code.

### 0b. The keyboard promise disagreed with the keyboard - both ways at once - **closed**

The most-read claim in the product was wrong in the two places somebody reads first, and wrong in *opposite*
directions. The public docs said *"what is never captured: which key you pressed"* and that the recorder
*"reads a single flag per keystroke and nothing else"*. This repository said, in three strings a model reads,
*"stores that a key was pressed and which key"*. The truth is narrower than the first and stricter than the
second: a key that can produce a character is counted and never identified, and a key that cannot spell
anything is recorded **by name** - see [17 - Privacy](17-privacy-security.md#the-keyboard-exactly).

**Nothing could have caught it.** Five hundred checks asserted that the code does what the code does; not one
compared the prose against it. It was found while reading the agent for an unrelated task, which is not a
process.

Closed by writing the rule out exactly, in both repositories, and by `agent/check-promises.mjs`, which
compares the key names parsed out of both agents against the list printed in the privacy page, in both
directions, and refuses either retired slogan in any string a model reads. It runs first in `npm test`, and
`--site` extends it to the deployed public docs. **The pattern is worth reusing**: the next claim about the
code that lives only in prose belongs in that file too.

### 1. `image/${format}` produces `image/image/jpeg` — three sites — **closed**

Both agents send `format: "image/jpeg"` on `/shot` — a **full MIME type**, which is what
[`agent/PROTOCOL.md`](../../agent/PROTOCOL.md) requires. Three places treated it as a bare extension and
prefixed `image/` again: the model request in `plan.ts`, the checkpoint gate's thumbnail in `CreateView.tsx`,
and the Live Context panel. The first was a hard **HTTP 400** — *Plan it* failed whenever **Stay on this
window** was on, which is the only case that attaches a screenshot; the other two depended on how tolerant a
browser is about a malformed data-URL MIME type.

All three now go through the existing helper — `mediaType(shot.format)` for the request and
`data:${mediaType(shot.format)};base64,…` for the images — and the third site no longer exists at all: the
Live Context panel was removed when the Create page's right column became the run history. **This is the
exact bug class the protocol document already carries a paragraph about** — "This line used to say `'jpeg'`,
the second implementation followed it, and generating a flow answered 400 on that machine until somebody
tried it" — which is why it is worth leaving written down rather than deleting.

### 2. The service worker is dead code

[`web/public/sw.js`](../../web/public/sw.js) is served, and **nothing registers it** — there is no
`navigator.serviceWorker` call anywhere in `web/src` or `web/index.html`. Its shell list also still names
`app.css` and `app.js`, which were the pre-React build's files and no longer exist, so registering it as-is
would cache a 404 into the install step. The app is installable (the manifest and icons are real) but has no
offline behaviour.

### 3. Two deployment hostnames in the tree — and in the extension it was not cosmetic

The API's CORS fallback origin and the Vite dev proxy target are `https://mouse-agent.vercel.app`, while the
macOS installer's default origin and the documented deployment are `https://mouseflowapp.vercel.app`. The
page is same-origin so the fallback never bites it, and every install command is built from `location.origin`
— but the two names disagree, and the CORS fallback is the one that would matter to a non-browser caller.

**Fixed for the extension on 2026-08-25, where the same disagreement was breaking a feature.** Its
`content_scripts.matches` and `externally_connectable.matches` listed only `mouse-agent.vercel.app`, which is
an alias that 307s to `mouseflowapp.vercel.app` and serves nothing itself. A match pattern is tested against
the page's FINAL url, so `bridge.js` never loaded on the live app and the one-click "connect the extension"
handover could not work in production — the redirect that makes the old name look alive is exactly what hides
this. Both names are listed now, and `APP_URL` in `popup.js`/`background.js` plus `SHARED_URL` in `agent.js`
point at the real one.

### 4. Stale instructions about stopping the Windows agent

Both of these predate the 0.8.2 tray icon and are now wrong, or at least incomplete:

- [`ConnectView.tsx`](../../web/src/features/connect/ConnectView.tsx), Windows step 2: *"Leave it open
  afterwards — closing it is how you stop the agent, and there is no other off switch."* There is now: the
  tray's **Quit MouseFlow Agent**.
- [`AppLayout.tsx`](../../web/src/shell/AppLayout.tsx), the agent pill's tooltip: *"To stop it, close its
  PowerShell window."* Shown on **both** platforms, so on macOS it names a window that does not exist.

### 5. `AGENT_WANTS` trails the agents — **fixed**

`AGENT_WANTS` is `0.9.2` (`web/src/lib/agent.ts`), which is what both agents report.

The reasoning changed rather than the number merely catching up. It used to be a judgement call: 0.8.0 was
the build that satisfied everything the client *required*, so trailing was defensible. Now the nudge is
**deliberate and load-bearing** — an update prompt is the only way somebody on 0.8.x learns that the install
step is gone and a goal skill no longer needs a worker beside the agent. A client that quietly accepted the
old build would leave them installing a second program for nothing.

### 6. The macOS agent's four new `#ctx` keys are emitted and never read

`role`, `subrole`, `in` and `inName` are written above every click the macOS agent resolves. `parseMacro`
([`web/src/lib/macro.ts`](../../web/src/lib/macro.ts)) and `ctxOf`
([`api/_transcript.js`](../../api/_transcript.js)) both keep only `app`, `window`, `control` and `type`, so
the new keys are dropped before a recording reaches the account.

Harmless — the format's unknown-key rule is exactly what makes it so — but it is half a feature until the
consuming side lands, and the half that landed is the one that costs a rebuild to change. The point of the
role tokens is that `type` is localised (`kAXRoleDescription` says *"кнопка папки с закладками"* on a Russian
Mac), so the transcript is the half that needs them most.

### 7. Stale sections in the older documents

- [`README.md`](../../README.md) still describes the pre-React app (*"index.html app.css app.js — the whole
  UI, no framework, no build"*), lists *"Windows only"* under known limits, and carries an agent API table
  without `/shot`, `/pulse`, `/windows`, `/do` or `/record/drain`. The deploy section also says the app is
  static with no build step, which `vercel.json` contradicts.
- [`extension/README.md`](../../extension/README.md) has a *"Still to wire"* section saying the web app cannot
  talk to the extension yet and that a content-script bridge is the fix. That bridge exists
  (`extension/bridge.js`, `web/src/lib/bridge.ts`) and is what Create's browser mode runs on.

## The border that says a machine is being driven, and where it does not yet say it

Since 0.22.0 both agents draw a border round every screen while something is driving the computer. Two
things it does not do yet, stated here rather than left to be discovered:

- **On the browser-driven path it pulses instead of burning steadily.** The browser runs the loop and never
  tells the agent that a run is happening — what the agent sees is `/shot`, `/windows`, up to 75 seconds of
  silence while the model thinks, then `/do`. So the border lights per action and goes out a few seconds
  after the last one. Making it steady is a protocol addition (a run-scoped start/stop) plus a change to
  `web/src/lib/desktop-engine.ts`; the courier path already burns steadily because it has real edges. The
  deliberate choice was a lease short enough that "out" is true over one long enough to bridge a model
  turn, because an indicator that lies *after* the end is worse than one that blinks.
- **On Windows older than 10 2004 a single action does not light the border.**
  `SetWindowDisplayAffinity(WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE)` is what keeps it out of the agent's own screenshots and
  does not exist there, and the six-second lease is the one driver that would then animate across the
  driver's own before/after comparison — every turn, on the comparison that decides whether an action did
  anything. So on those machines the border is shown for goal runs and replays, which hold steady for a
  whole run and cannot animate, and not for single actions. The agent says which of the two it is in its
  startup banner. macOS has two locks and needs no such rule.

Neither is a reason to hold the feature: a person who cannot tell that their mouse is about to be driven is
a worse problem than a border in a screenshot.

---

## The browser extension against the desktop agents

The extension is a second product driving a second surface, and it has its own brain: `extension/agent.js`
carries its own `SYSTEM`, its own `TOOLS` and its own wave loop rather than reading `api/_brain.mjs`, which
the two desktop drivers share. Everything below follows from that split — improvements to the shared brain
have been landing on the desktop side only.

Four of these were not gaps but faults, and all four are fixed. The first two are struck through in the
table below; these two had no row because nobody had thought to look for them:

- **A turn that called no tool was filed as a success.** Both desktop drivers treat it as a failure and
  carry the model's own prose into the reason; this side returned `ok: true`. It mattered more here than
  there, because `background.js` maps `result.ok` straight to the run's outcome, pushes that to the account,
  and the panel offers a successful run as the basis for a reusable skill — so a run that did nothing became
  a saved skill that does nothing.
- **A recording made in the panel could not be reached.** Stop wrote it into the worker's storage and the
  screen said it was on the Record page in the app, which was not true and could not become true — sync
  pushes skills and runs, never recordings. The panel sent nine messages and none was about a recording;
  the replay engine and `skills.js` were written, correct, and had no caller from this UI. There is now a
  **Recorded here** list with play, keep-as-skill (which also pushes it to the account) and delete.
- **`finish` in the same batch as real work discarded the work.** The turn looked for `finish` among the
  calls before carrying any of them out, so "click Send, then finish" finished without clicking and reported
  the errand done. The model batches `finish` constantly, because it saves a turn.
- **Stop could not stop a turn.** `isAborted` was checked between turns and between actions, and the request
  to the model carried no abort signal — so pressing Stop during the eight-to-fifty seconds a turn takes did
  nothing until the next turn, and there might not be one. There was no timeout either.

What is still open, measured rather than estimated:

| | desktop | extension |
|---|---|---|
| actions the model can ask for | 21 | ~~9~~ 16 |
| sees the screen | screenshots | DOM by default, `capture_page` on request — see below |
| checkpoints | `reached_checkpoint` plus a gate the loop waits on | ~~none~~ the same tool, plan and gate, answered in the panel |
| gives up when nothing changes | warns at 3, stops at 6 | ~~no equivalent~~ same two thresholds, measured on the DOM |
| caps the actions in one turn | `BATCH_MAX` 6, nothing after a terminal action | ~~none~~ the same 6, and nothing after `wait`/`navigate`/`open_tab` |
| prunes old snapshots | `forgetOldPictures` each turn | ~~none~~ `forgetOldPages`, by size rather than type |
| model timeout, cancellable | yes | ~~no~~ same 75s, and Stop now cancels the request in flight |
| one failed action ends the turn | `notBatched` says so to the model | ~~no~~ yes, with the same sentence to each dropped call |
| `finish` in a batch | acted on in order | ~~found first, discarding the turn's real work~~ in order |
| narrated transcript | `api/_transcript.js` | none |
| run from the account | the courier claims jobs | ~~refused~~ a claimer of its own, off until switched on |
| modifiers in a recording | `mods` on the `#ctx` line since 0.21.0 | ~~none~~ `mods` on the click, same four words in the same order |
| parameters in a recorded skill | derived from typing and the control's name | ~~`params: []`~~ one per field typed into, named after it |

**How the three implementations are held in step**, since they cannot share a module: `extension/agent.js`
is copied into the package rather than bundled (see `web/vite.extension.config.ts` on what is built and what
is copied), so it cannot import `api/_brain.mjs`. `extension/check-extension.mjs` therefore holds them in
step the way `agent/test-contract.mjs` holds the two desktop agents — by executing both sides and asserting
they agree. `MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS`, `STILL_WARN`, `STILL_GIVE_UP` and `BATCH_MAX` are checked against the
desktop's on every run.

**Where the two surfaces genuinely differ, and why it is not a translation error.** The desktop decides "the
screen moved" from a 64×36 pixel fingerprint; there are no pixels here, so the extension fingerprints what
an action hands back anyway — address, title, the name of any open dialog, how many elements are shown of
how many, and the element list itself including the value of each field, because text typed into a box is a
change that shows in nothing else. And `scroll` is terminal on the desktop but not here: a desktop action is
aimed at a coordinate that scrolling moves, while a browser action is aimed at an element reference that
survives it.

`hover`, `refresh` and `note` are now there, and `click` grew `button` and `double` — the replay engine
had both from the start and the model could ask for neither. `hover` needed almost no machinery: `travelTo`
in `extension/content.js` already raises `pointerover`/`mouseover` the whole way to its target, so the work
was done and there was simply no tool reaching it. It says in its own description what it cannot do: a menu
drawn purely by the CSS `:hover` rule stays shut, because no synthetic event triggers that. And `navigate`
to the address you are already on no longer claims `{navigated: url}` — `goTo` returns early there, so a
stuck page read as one that had just been reloaded and was still stuck.

**Extension skills reach the account's own surfaces now.** `flowFromSkill` pushed every row without a
`role`, and `roleOf` in `api/_flow-role.mjs` reads exactly that — so `mouseflow_recordings` never named an
extension skill and `mouseflow_run` never reached one. Even the carefully written refusal ("aims at elements
in a web page, so the extension is the half that can replay it") was unreachable for them: as far as that
side was concerned they did not exist. They are stamped `skill` now, and `check-extension.mjs` holds the
spelling in step with the server's. What is still missing is the claimer — a browser skill remains something
only a person sitting in Chrome can start.

**Modifiers are recorded and replayed.** Four booleans the DOM event already carried. Shift-click for a
range, Cmd/Ctrl-click to add to a selection or open in a new tab — recorded as bare clicks, replayed as bare
clicks, and reported as a clean run: the same silently-wrong result the desktop half spent three commits
fixing. Written with the same words in the same order as `chordName` in the agents (Cmd, Ctrl, Alt, Shift),
and the check asserts the order is taken from the agent rather than invented. Scroll carries none: the
recorder hears the `scroll` event, which has no modifier state, not the wheel.

**Checkpoints work, and the panel is why they can.** A run started with "stop and ask me" asks for a plan
of three to six checkpoints before the first turn, is offered `reached_checkpoint` only because there is a
gate to answer it, and stands still on the announcement until somebody presses Carry on or Stop here. The
announcement cuts the turn: any amount of time passes while a person looks, so an action batched behind it
was aimed at a page they are no longer seeing. Stopping is reported as *"Stopped at checkpoint 2 — About to
send. It said: …"* rather than the word `stopped`, because where it stopped is the only thing worth knowing.

The surface is the side panel, not the popup — a popup closes on the first click into the page, and this
wait lasts as long as the person wants. That is what the panel was built for. The plan is best effort: if
it cannot be obtained the run goes ahead ungated and says so in the feed, because refusing to work over an
optional step would be worse.

**The page says when it is being driven.** The desktop agents draw a lime border round every screen while
something is driving the computer; the extension now draws the same border round the viewport, with a small
pill naming which of the two is happening — a run, or a replay of a recording. It moves with the agent from
tab to tab and comes off every tab the run touched, the way the drawn cursor already did.

Two of the desktop's four traps apply here and are closed the same way: it is `pointer-events: none`, or it
would swallow every click on the page, and it is drawn only in the top frame, or a page of four iframes
would get four borders. Two are different. There are no screenshots to keep it out of — but there IS a text
sample: `read_page` hands the model `document.body.innerText`, so the sign lives in a **closed shadow root**
and its words never reach what the model reads as page content. And it carries `aria-hidden`, because it is
a statement about the window rather than part of the page, and a screen reader announcing it mid-form is a
nuisance to exactly the person who can least afford one.

**A recorded browser skill can take values now**, which is the whole difference between a skill and a
macro. The recorder still does not capture what was typed and never will — it records a `blank`: which
field, what it is called, how many keystrokes went in, and nothing else. That is the same bargain the
desktop struck, and it is enough: every field typed into becomes exactly one parameter, named after the
field, filled in at run time. Password fields are skipped entirely, length included — a keystroke count is
a hint about how long a password is. A recording that types into something cannot be played back raw, and
says why rather than filling the field with nothing.

**The account can start a skill in Chrome now.** `mouseflow_run` used to refuse a browser skill outright
and tell the user to run it themselves; the queue routes by surface instead. A claimer declaring
`kind: "browser"` is offered only skills whose source is not `desktop`, and every other claimer is offered
only what is not one — which also closes a latent bug the refusal had been hiding, since `flowBody` builds a
five-column body out of `payload.events` and a browser skill's events carry selectors and no coordinates.

The extension's claimer is off until somebody switches it on in the panel, and says while it is on that it
asks the account for work and that nothing reaches in — the same stance and nearly the same words as the
agents' menu-bar switch. It is an ALARM rather than a held request: a long poll keeps an MV3 service worker
resident all day, and `chrome.alarms` is the sanctioned way to be woken instead. The cost is stated rather
than hidden: one minute is the shortest period MV3 allows, so a queued job waits up to a minute here where
the desktop agent takes it in about three seconds. A claim is refused outright while a recording, a replay
or a run is already going — one browser, one thing at a time.

**A replayed recording finds its tab, and opens it when it is not there.** The `focus` step matched the tab
sitting at the position it was recorded in, and never opened one. For a person pressing Play that is right —
they arranged their own tabs. For a run started from the account it is fatal: nobody is there to arrange
anything, and a recording made in anything but the first tab cannot run. Measured on a live run: a recording
of example.com made as the eleventh tab, started from a chat into a window with one, came back with "this
step needs the tab at position 11". The claimer worked and there was nothing it could usefully do.

Three tries now, in this order: the recorded position first, because it preserves the arrangement the person
had in mind; the address second, because the same page moved elsewhere is still that page; and opening it
last, because that is the only step which creates something and doing it earlier would multiply tabs that
are already open. The old error ended with the words "open it first" — opening is exactly that, done for a
person who may not be there.

**A sentence, rather than the id of something already saved.** Ten MCP tools, and every one of them was
about what had already been recorded: `mouseflow_run` takes a `skill`. There was no way to say "open the
mail and find the message from Ann" through MCP on EITHER surface — a goal reached the queue only as a
saved *created* skill, which somebody had to make first. `mouseflow_do` takes the errand itself.

It was browser-only at first, and that was not small print: the extension carries its own model and the
desktop agent carries none. Since 14a the free desktop goal steps through `?worker=step` with the model on
the server, and since 2026-09-28 `mouseflow_do` reaches it with `on: "desktop"`. The same date gave it
`expect` and `ref`, so a test case that lives in another system (TestRail) can be run and judged here
without being copied here; see `checkedReport` in `api/_case.mjs`. The queue marks the job `#goal.browser` rather than `#goal` for that reason: work
only one surface can do has to say so, or the other takes it and answers "I do not understand", and the
turn is spent.

**Finding what the snapshot did not show, and looking with eyes when the elements say nothing.** The
snapshot is capped and admits it — "60 of 840" — and until now there was no way to ask about the other 780
except to scroll and look again, a turn per attempt. `find_element` searches the whole page, exact name
first, then the same name in any case, then a part of one, and when several match it returns them all
rather than choosing: two controls with one name is something to know before clicking, not after. Its refs
are ADDED to the ones already held rather than replacing them — a fresh snapshot would renumber everything,
so finding one control would cost every other.

`capture_page` is the browser's answer to `capture_window`, and deliberately not its twin: the desktop one
saves a file and puts it on the clipboard, this one exists so the model can look. It is the expensive route
and its description says so — elements carry names and refs you can act on, a picture carries neither — but
some things are not in the DOM at all, the Excel Online grid being the example this repository already
names, and a look before an irreversible click is worth its price. Only the visible part of the tab: that
is what the API captures, and promising more would promise what it does not do. Old pictures are dropped
from the history whole rather than trimmed, the way `forgetOldPictures` does it on the desktop.

Still missing: `scroll_to`, `drag`, `clipboard_read`, `clipboard_write`, `open_app`, `activate_window` and
`wait_for_window`. Of those, `open_app` and `activate_window` are desktop-only by definition.

**Not a gap:** the recording format. The extension anchors a step to a selector and a tab, the desktop to a
coordinate plus `#ctx`. That is a different anchor for a different surface, and the browser's is the better
one there; `api/_macro.mjs` has no notion of a selector and should not grow one.

## Where this would go next

Carried over from the project's own notes, and still current:

- **A signed per-user installer** for Windows, replacing both start paths: one byte-identical signed binary
  (so it accumulates SmartScreen hash reputation — a per-user-unique build never can), the pairing token in
  the URL rather than baked into the file, a `mouseflow://` scheme for relaunch, and the autostart task
  registered at install time. This is what removes the PowerShell paste entirely.
- **A notarised, prebuilt macOS `.app`** — no compiler on the user's machine at all. A Developer ID now exists
  and the installer prefers it; notarisation is the remaining step, and it is a distribution project rather
  than an installer flag.
- **Anchored desktop recording — done in September 2026** (agent 0.25.0). A click carries the rectangle of
  its window and of the control it hit; the app puts the point back inside that window before a replay and
  the agent walks it to the control by name, and the note says how many of each. What still breaks, and it
  is worth knowing precisely: a control that was **renamed** is not found by name and falls back to the
  window recalculation; an application that **names nothing** (Electron without an accessibility tree) has
  no element rectangle at all, so the window is all there is; **three windows of one application** with a
  changed title are not matched, deliberately, because a guess that misses is worse than an honest "played
  as recorded"; and a **relaid-out** window - the same size, different arrangement - is only saved by the
  name, never by the geometry. See [04 — Record](04-record.md).
- **A recording no longer contains what stopped it — done in September 2026** (agent 0.26.0, and the app
  half works with any agent). Both doors out of a recording were captured inside it, and the tray one was
  self-reproducing: the replay's last act was to press **Stop and Save Recording** again, which started a
  new recording. The agent cuts at the moment its own menu opened; the app cuts a trailing press on a
  window carrying its own title. **Why it takes two halves and not one:** a click on the tray icon carries no
  window title at all — measured on the real recording — so the app-side rule cannot see that door even in
  principle, and an agent older than 0.26.0 still writes its tray stop into the recording.
  **What this costs, precisely:** a recording whose genuine last action was
  a click *in MouseFlow itself* loses that click — recording work on MouseFlow is rare, and a recording
  that presses Stop on replay is broken always. And the app half recognises our window **by title**, so a
  page in another browser window whose own title contains "MouseFlow" — the docs site, for instance —
  would be read as ours if a click on it were the very last thing in a recording. One click, only at the
  very end, only on a title match: the alternative was a clock, which is wrong more often and in both
  directions. See [04 — Record](04-record.md).
- **Raising the right window before a replay — done in September 2026.** Three defects on one road, each
  found by playing a recording back rather than by reading: the sampler's first window is MouseFlow itself,
  a minimised window was refused by the matcher that decides what to raise, and a window that was not open
  fell back to raising us. What remains, and it is a real limit: a recording made in the **agent's own
  terminal window** cannot be raised at all — `activate` refuses its own console by design, because
  bringing it to the front is how the next action lands in it — and **three windows of one application**
  with changed titles are still not matched, deliberately. Both end as an honest "nothing was raised"
  rather than a click somewhere else. See [04 — Record](04-record.md).
- **A taskbar click replays as "show that window", and a replay releases only what it held — done in
  September 2026** (agent 0.27.0). Both from one run: the recorded taskbar click toggled the window the
  page had just raised, and the finish's unconditional right-button release opened a context menu at the
  cursor. What remains: the translation needs the `Focus` note the agent writes after a foreground change, so
  a taskbar click that did **not** change the foreground window — a button for a window already in front —
  still plays as a click and still toggles; and a window whose *title* is not unique (two terminals both
  called "Windows PowerShell") is raised by the first match. The Dock on macOS does not toggle, so it needs
  nothing. See [10 — Agent protocol](10-agent-protocol.md).
- **Agent authentication.** One seam, one scheme.
- **Text for the steps that need it**, if it can be done safely. Keystroke *timing* is captured; the content
  is not, and adding it needs a redaction design rather than a hook. The alternative already works: a created
  skill is told what to write.
- **A Tauri build** — the same UI as a ~5 MB desktop app, which removes the agent install, the loopback bridge
  and the Safari limitation in one move.
- **Shared flows** as documents rather than account rows.

Ruled out along the way, so nobody re-opens them: `ms-appinstaller:` (disabled by default since App Installer
1.21.3421.0, December 2023, after it was abused to bypass SmartScreen) and ClickOnce (unsupported by Chrome).
