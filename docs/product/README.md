# MouseFlow — product documentation

Every module, every option, and the reasoning behind each one, written from the code rather than from a
plan for it.

**No commit is named here any more.** This line used to pin one (`17bbcc5`, agents 0.8.2, extension
0.16.2) and then sat unchanged while the agents reached 0.29.0 and the extension 0.17.0 — so the one
sentence that claimed to say how current the set was, was the most out-of-date sentence in it. A version
belongs in the page that documents that thing, where changing the thing and changing the number are the
same edit. The stack is React 19, Vite and TanStack Router.

## Two products, and two ways in

This set documents **one engine sold as two products** (`docs/SPLIT-PLAN.md`). The table below is the
**whole set**, in one place, and it stays that way — a page belongs to the product it is about, and the
parts underneath belong to both.

| | |
|---|---|
| [“Do it for me”](do.md) | The machine acts and the person watches: a goal, a queue, evidence, and a check that says whether it is still true tomorrow |
| [“Make it reusable”](make.md) | The person acts and the machine watches: a recording, a transcript, a skill, a document, and where the week went |

Each of those is an **index over these same pages**, not a second copy. The screen rows in them carry the
screen's route, and `agent/check-promises.mjs` reads those routes and asks `web/src/lib/product.ts` — the
one file that says which half a screen belongs to. So a page filed under the wrong product fails the
suite, and a page added here and put in neither index fails it too. That is the whole reason the routes
are printed: this repository has paid twice for two lists that agreed for a week.

## How this is organised

| | |
|---|---|
| [01 — Overview](01-overview.md) | What the product is, the three clients, why the split exists, the capability matrix |
| [02 — Concepts and vocabulary](02-concepts.md) | Recording, session, part, flow, skill, run, transcript, role, source, identity |
| [03 — The web app shell](03-web-app.md) | Routes, sidebar, top bar, theme, sign-in wall, settings dialog, PWA state |
| [04 — Record](04-record.md) | The recorder, long sessions, the recordings table, the transcript panel, held recordings, cross-device reconciliation |
| [05 — Create](05-create.md) | Prompt → flow: the two executors, the plan, checkpoint gates, window pinning, live context, the decision loop |
| [06 — Skills](06-skills.md) | The skill library, roles, save-as-skill, tool schemas, publishing, extension pairing |
| [07 — Gallery](07-gallery.md) | Collections, browse and collection views, install, publish, withdraw |
| [08 — Dashboard and the assistant](08-dashboard.md) | Every metric, every gap, the grounded chat and its read-only tools |
| [09 — Connections](09-connections.md) | The install flows for both platforms, Local Network Access, autostart |
| [10 — Agent protocol](10-agent-protocol.md) | The loopback HTTP contract: every endpoint, parameter, event word and body grammar |
| [11 — The Windows agent](11-agent-windows.md) | Flags, tray icon, hooks, capabilities, platform limits |
| [12 — The macOS agent](12-agent-macos.md) | Installer flags, code signing, TCC permissions, menu bar, self-restart, `--doctor` |
| [13 — The Chrome extension](13-extension.md) | Modes, message API, event format, settings, what it cannot do |
| [14 — HTTP API](14-http-api.md) | Every serverless route with its parameters, caps and auth rules |
| [15 — Data model](15-data-model.md) | Tables, payload shapes, `localStorage` keys, sync and reconciliation rules |
| [16 — Transcript engine](16-transcript.md) | How a recording becomes prose, and how an edit is applied and undone |
| [17 — Privacy and security](17-privacy-security.md) | What is captured and what is deliberately not, credentials, CORS, rate limits |
| [18 — Configuration reference](18-configuration.md) | Every environment variable, flag, query parameter, storage key and tuning constant |
| [19 — Limits and known gaps](19-limits-and-known-gaps.md) | Inherent limits, unverified areas, and defects found while writing this |
| [20 — Operations](20-operations.md) | Deploy, migrate, develop, test |
| [21 — MCP](21-mcp.md) | Connecting an AI to an account: every tool, how it signs in, how it comes to be allowed to act on your computer, what it refuses, and what to do when an answer says something did not happen |
| [22 — Teams](22-teams.md) | Who may see whose work, the three roles, and the much longer list of what a team deliberately does not open |
| [23 — Process documents](23-documents.md) | A procedure written from one recording, every line citing its step, kept as an object somebody can correct |
| [27 — Test cases](27-cases.md) | A skill plus what must be true when it has run, on a nightly schedule: the four verdicts, why "no verdict" is not a failure, and why nothing without evidence is ever green |
| [26 — Activity](26-activity.md) | Running, waiting and everything that ran on one page, with Stop and Cancel beside the thing itself; the status vocabulary, and why the history is the journal plus the queue |
| [25 — Checks and tests](25-tests.md) | `expect`: an assertion the machine decides from the accessibility tree rather than the model from a picture, its three outcomes, and why a run's checks are not its outcome |
| [24 — Schedules](24-schedules.md) | Runs nobody asks for: a time of day or an interval, ticked by the machine's own poll rather than a cron, and what it says when the machine was asleep |

## Two conventions this documentation keeps

**Measured numbers are marked as measured.** Where a figure came from running the thing (69 bytes an
event, 81.8% of clicks named on macOS, 70.8% on Windows) it is stated as measured and where it came
from. Where something has never been observed working, that is stated too — see
[19 — Limits and known gaps](19-limits-and-known-gaps.md).

**The screenshots are of the app, not of a drawing of it.** Every picture in these documents was taken from
the running application, against the development fixture account (`MOCK_API=1`), at the deployment's own
address so the URLs in them are the URLs you would paste. Two are **staged**, and say so where they appear:
the "Claude asked to start a recording here" banner and the Connections screen before a machine is attached,
both of which need a computer that is *not* already attached — and the machine these were taken on is. The
consent page is rendered from the same function the server sends, rather than mocked up, because a picture
of a consent screen that is not the consent screen is the one picture nobody should draw.

Regenerate them with `node scripts/shoot-docs.mjs`, and look at what comes out — the script cannot tell a
rendered page from a rendered error.

**Absent is not the same as false.** The product draws this distinction everywhere: a capability flag
that is missing means "this agent is too old to say", not "no"; a `#ctx` line that is absent means "not
known", not "nothing was there". The documentation follows the same rule, because collapsing the two is
how a transcript, a dashboard or a document starts asserting things nobody can support.

## Also in the repository

- [`README.md`](../../README.md) — the original project readme. Parts of it predate the React rewrite; where
  it disagrees with these documents, these documents were written from the code.
- [`docs/QA-ROADMAP.md`](../QA-ROADMAP.md) — where this goes next: the eight items that take the agent from
  "reliable on short tasks" to nightly regression testing, each with files, schema, tests, docs and a definition
  of done. Written to be executed by whoever picks it up.
- [`agent/PROTOCOL.md`](../../agent/PROTOCOL.md) — the normative agent contract. If you are writing a third
  agent, that file is the specification and [10 — Agent protocol](10-agent-protocol.md) is the guided tour.
- [`docs/DEBUG-MAC.md`](../DEBUG-MAC.md), [`docs/DEBUG-WINDOWS.md`](../DEBUG-WINDOWS.md) — per-platform
  debugging, including what is verified on real hardware and what is not.
- [`extension/README.md`](../../extension/README.md) — the extension's own engineering notes.
