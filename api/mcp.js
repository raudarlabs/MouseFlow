 *   POST /api/mcp                    JSON-RPC 2.0. initialize, ping, tools/list, tools/call

 *   POST /api/mcp?worker=claim       a worker on somebody's machine takes the next job  (long-polls)
 *   POST /api/mcp?worker=report      ...and says how it went
 *   GET  /api/mcp?worker=state&id=   ...and asks whether it has been cancelled meanwhile
 *   POST /api/mcp?worker=crash       ...and says when it fell over, so the crash is not only in a log file
 *   POST /api/mcp?worker=step        ...or, with no worker at all, an agent carries out a goal one turn
 *                                    at a time: it sends the screen, this decides, it does the action
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE mcp/server.mjs. That one runs on the user's machine over stdio, which is why it can
 * run anything: the agent listens on loopback and only something on that machine can reach it. It also means
 * one person, one terminal. This is the same tools reachable from Claude on a phone, in a browser, in
 * somebody else's editor - and reachable is the whole problem, because a serverless function cannot dial into
 * anybody's desktop and nothing on the internet should be able to.
 *
 * So the desktop dials out. A tools/call becomes a row in run_queue; a worker on the user's own machine
 * claims it, runs it through the agent it can already reach, and reports back; this waits and answers with
 * what the worker said. The direction of the connection never reverses. A machine with no worker running
 * claims nothing, and the caller is told exactly that rather than left waiting.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS THE POINT. Every request resolves ONE user through whoIsCalling - a session cookie, or the
 * device token the extension already pairs with - and every query filters on that id inside the WHERE
 * clause. There is no route here that takes a user id, and no code path that reads one from the request
 * body. A model-supplied user id is the whole bug class: one hallucinated uuid and this becomes a way to
 * list, or run, somebody else's skills. So the id arrives once, from the credential, and the credential is
 * the only thing that says who anybody is.
 *
 * That is also the answer to "each person in an organisation sees only themselves": each person adds this
 * with their OWN token, and sees their own skills. The one thing to be careful of is a connector installed
 * once for a whole organisation with a single shared header - everyone on it would share one account, which
 * is not multi-tenancy, it is one tenant with many users. The fix for that is OAuth, so the connector
 * identifies the person rather than the installation; the 401 below already advertises where that will live
 * (RFC 9728), and until it exists this is per-person-token.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. The local agent. Whether it is running, what version, whether a replay is playing -
 * all of that is loopback and this is not on that machine. `mouseflow_status` reports what the ACCOUNT
 * knows and says plainly which half it cannot see, rather than guessing.

 * logged the two ways that shows up, over and over: `HTTP 0` when the connection died before the headers,
 * and `HTTP 200` when it died after them with the body half sent - a reply that says `{ ok: true, job: null }`

 * on this project's own account, a skill's definition is about 184 tokens, so fifty skills is roughly 9,200
 * tokens of tool definitions in front of every message - and a permission list of fifty entries named after
 * the date each recording was made.
 *
 * So the list stays constant and the skills move into a RESULT. `mouseflow_recordings` names them and their
 * inputs; this runs one. The names being unreadable stops mattering, because nobody reads a tool list to
 * find them any more.
 *
 * WHAT IS GIVEN UP, and it is not nothing: `arguments` is a free object, so a model can no longer be forced
 * by the schema to supply a required input. That guarantee moves one turn later - missingParams() already
 * refuses and names what is missing - so it holds, it just costs a round trip. A guarantee enforced by a
 * refusal is weaker than one enforced by a type, and this is the trade being made on purpose.

     * on a machine running both went to whichever long-poll landed first, and it was observed doing exactly
     * that - the courier took it and answered "does not understand".

     * reinstalled. The worker is a checkout of this repository run by node - it updates with `git pull`.
     * Declaring on the side that can actually be updated is what makes the fix land.
     *

   * показывала «Nothing is running», пока вокруг экрана горела зелёная рамка. Остановить его было нечем,

   * машины и неправдой для человека.
   *
   * Поэтому страница ОБЪЯВЛЯЕТ свой прогон: `start` кладёт строку сразу claimed (забирать её агенту нечего -
   * claim берёт только queued), `step` подкладывает шаги, чтобы Activity показывала их живьём, `end` закрывает.
   * Отмена - тем же ?cancel, что у любой строки: страница видит state = cancelled в том же опросе, которым
   * рисует чужие прогоны, и останавливает цикл. Одна очередь, одна кнопка Stop, и «занята ли машина» для
   * расписаний теперь учитывает и прогон с страницы - одна мышь. */
